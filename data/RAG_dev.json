Laurel and Hardy are injured when they are traveling in Fields\u2019s car in the State of Emporia and Fields collides with Gleason. Laurel and Hardy bring a diversity action against Fields and Gleason in federal court. Under Emporia case law, it is unclear whether, if Gleason and Fields were both negligent, they would be liable for their percentages of fault (several liability) or each liable for the plaintiff\u2019s full damages (joint and several liability). The federal district judge, making her best guess at the law of Emporia on the liability of joint tortfeasors, concludes that the Emporia Supreme Court would apply joint and several liability. Consequently, after the jury finds both Fields and Gleason negligent, she holds each defendant liable for Laurel and Hardy\u2019s full damages, rather than for reduced damages based on each defendant\u2019s percentage of negligence. Fields appeals her ruling to the federal Court of Appeals. Gleason does not appeal. While Fields\u2019s appeal is pending, the Emporia Supreme Court holds, in an unrelated case, that several liability is the proper rule in joint tortfeasor cases. Fields\u2019s federal appeal is heard after the Emporia Supreme Court\u2019s decision comes down. Fields argues that the Court of Appeals should apply several liability to his case, even though the trial judge had applied joint and several liability.

When he purchases his lift ticket, he quickly signs a release of liability, waiving his right to sue, should he be injured due to negligence of the operator. While coming down an expert trail, he comes suddenly upon a bare spot full of rocks. He falls and is injured. He brings a diversity action against the operator in federal court in Rhode Island, basing personal jurisdiction on the fact that it had sent him an offer there for a weekend ski package that induced him to go to Vermont to ski. Assume that Rhode Island tort law refuses to enforce advance waivers of liability for negligence, unless they were individually negotiated. Assume further that Vermont tort law holds such waivers enforceable. Assume further that Rhode Island\u2019s choice-of-law rule for tort cases is to apply the law of the place of the injury, while Vermont\u2019s choice-of-law rule involves an assessment of the interests of the parties and states involved. It is less predictable under this balancing approach to choice of law whether the court would apply Rhode Island or Vermont law. The Rhode Island federal district judge would probably apply", "6.

Columbus sues Moriarty in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Her claim is for an injury she suffered in Tennessee, when she was hit by a bullet fired by one of a group of hunters. Her injuries are grievous, so her damages evidence will be graphic and moving. There is a significant question in the case as to whether it was Moriarty who shot her. Moriarty moves to bifurcate the trial, that is, to try the issue of whether his bullet hit Columbus first\u2014and have the jury decide it\u2014before trying the damages issues. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) authorizes federal courts to order a separate trial of one or more issues \u2018\u2018in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice.\u2019\u2019 However, Tennessee has a state constitutional provision that has been interpreted to require a single, unified trial of all the issues in a suit. The federal judge grants the motion for a separate trial, and the jury finds that it was not Moriarty\u2019s bullet that hit Columbus. Judgment therefore enters for Moriarty. Columbus appeals, arguing that the court should have applied the state unified-trial approach. The Court of Appeals should", "7. More slings and arrows. Clear Code Software agreed to create a litigation-support computer program for Holmes, a lawyer. It contracted out the writing of the code to Jasper, a Caltech grad student. Jasper wrote the code using a computer he rented from High Tech Rentals, Inc.

Jasper then asserted five claims. His first claim was a quantum meruit claim against Holmes for the value of the services he rendered in preparing the computer program. The second was a claim for defamation against Holmes, for claiming to Clear Code that his programming work was \u2018\u2018abominable.\u2019\u2019 His third claim was against High Tech, claiming that a glitch in the computer they rented to him caused the problem in the code, causing the Holmes program to fail.

Uberoth, a venture capitalist, sues Colon, an investment broker, in federal court. He alleges that Colon fraudulently induced Uberoth to invest in an internet start-up company, by knowingly making false statements about its prospects and the backgrounds of its officers. The case goes to trial. At the close of the evidence, Colon moves for a judgment as a matter of law, on the ground that Uberoth has not produced enough evidence to support a verdict that Colon knew, at the time he made the statements, that they were false. The judge denies the motion, and the jury subsequently returns a verdict finding Colon liable for the misrepresentation.

Perez sues the City of Atlantis, alleging that the mayor violated his First Amendment rights by demoting him from his city job to a lower-paying one because he had supported Appolonia, the losing candidate for mayor in the 2018 election. The City raises three defenses. It denies that Perez was demoted, arguing that he was transferred to an equivalent position. Second, it claims that the mayor never believed that Perez supported Appolonia, so could not have discriminated against him on that basis. Last, it claims that Perez had waived any claim for demotion when he agreed to accept his new position. The case went to trial on all three issues. The jury rendered a general verdict, finding the City liable to Perez for violating his First Amendment rights. A year later, Perez is fired.

But it could have been. Because a significant part of the events giving rise to the claim\u2014the accident\u2014took place there, the Western District is a proper venue under \u00a71391(b)(2), and both defendants would be subject to personal jurisdiction in Kentucky based on minimum contacts.

Scratch E from the list, and focus on the answers that deal with application of \u00a71406(a).", "In this example the federal judge did her best to ascertain the content of Emporia law. However, her prediction of Emporia law on joint and several liability turned out to be wrong. The Emporia Supreme Court has now made it clear that several liability is the law of Emporia. What should the federal diversity court now do about Laurel and Hardy\u2019s cases? There\u2019s an argument for A. The federal trial judge conscientiously performed her role under Erie: She made her best guess at the content of Emporia law, based on the precedents at the time, and applied it to the case. If Fields\u2019s appeal is decided under a \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 liability rule, it might have to be remanded for retrial, even though it was fairly tried under the law as the judge understood it at the time. This seems wasteful. On the other hand, by taking his appeal, Fields has challenged the trial judge\u2019s ruling that joint and several liability applies in Emporia. When the Court of Appeals reviews that ruling, shouldn\u2019t it consider all the data concerning the content of Emporia law? And what better data could there be on the point than this new decision from the Emporia Supreme Court? It seems artificial to uphold the trial judge\u2019s conclusion about Emporia law on the ground that it was reasonable at the time, when we now know that it was wrong. On this reasoning, the Court of Appeals will reverse the judgment against Fields and remand the case for entry of a new judgment based on several liability. The Court of Appeals, like the federal district court, must make its best guess at the content of Emporia law at the time it reviews the case, and it is now clear that several liability is the law of Emporia. Thus A is wrong. ", "But what will the federal trial court do about Gleason\u2019s motion for relief from judgment? Now that it is clear that Gleason\u2019s liability should be \u2018\u2018several\u2019\u2019 under Emporia law, shouldn\u2019t he get relief from the judgment, which was entered based on joint and several liability? There\u2019s an argument for Gleason\u2019s position, but it will very likely be rejected. Gleason\u2019s case is over. If he were allowed to challenge that judgment based on a later change\u2014or clarification\u2014of the law, judgments could be reopened whenever the law changed. This would place a large burden on the system, and undermine the finality of judgments. \u2018\u2018There is nothing in Erie that suggests that consistency must be achieved at the expense of finality, or that federal cases finally disposed of must be revisited any time an unrelated state case clarifies the applicable rules of law.\u2019\u2019 DeWeerth v. Baldinger, 38 F.3d 1266 (2d Cir. 1994). Fields\u2019s case is distinguishable, since he took an appeal, which was still pending at the time the state law changed. He had persisted in claiming that several liability applies and was still litigating the question in the original case when the Emporia court clarified its position. So, B is wrong. ", "So A is the best answer. Although Rhode Island wouldn\u2019t enforce this waiver in a domestic case, its choice-of-law rule calls for application of the law of the place of injury, and that means Vermont law rather than its own. ", "Thus, C is the best of the available answers. While this limitations period would not apply if it were a matter of federal judicial practice (see York), and probably could not be validly adopted as a Federal Rule (see 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b)), there\u2019s a strong argument, under Hanna\u2019s description of congressional power over procedure, that this statute could be enacted by Congress. After all, under Hanna, Congress has very broad authority to regulate procedure in the federal courts. You could imagine that Congress might seek to protect those courts from expending limited judicial resources on state claims by imposing a limitations period on diversity cases. It is very likely within its power to do so, and should be. Of course, it hasn\u2019t, and probably won\u2019t pass such a limitations statute, since such a statute would interfere significantly with the administration of state causes of action. The members of Congress do, after all, represent the states.", "D, quoting language from Byrd, suggests that the limitations period is so closely related to substance that state law would have to apply. There\u2019s an argument for this, that it is a situation in which the basic constitutional command of Erie mandates adherence to state law. But a limitations period is not definitively \u2018\u2018substantive,\u2019\u2019 as a duty-to-a- trespasser rule would be, nor indisputably \u2018\u2018procedural.\u2019\u2019 Very likely, it falls \u2018\u2018within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, [where the rule is] rationally capable of classification as either.\u2019\u2019 Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. If so, this passage from Hanna suggests that the statute is valid, even though it preempts a state rule that has substantive as well as procedural purposes. Hanna\u2019s endorsement of congressional power to enact rules for the federal courts that have substantive ramifications suggests that such interference with state policy is permissible in this \u2018\u2018gray zone\u2019\u2019 between substance and procedure. ", "A is wrong, because the use of federal procedure here doesn\u2019t turn on the outcome-determinative test. It turns on the Court\u2019s authority to write the rule. ", "B asserts that Jasper\u2019s first claim against Clear Code, for the contract price for the job, is a proper claim, but that his other claim, for the fee on an unrelated job, is improper. This isn\u2019t right. Both claims are counterclaims, the first, compulsory, the second, permissive. Rule 13(a) (1) requires Jasper to assert claims he has against an opposing party (here, the defendant/third-party plaintiff, Clear Code) if they arise from the same events as the main claim. The claim for Jasper\u2019s fee clearly does, so it is a compulsory counterclaim. His claim for his fee on another job is a permissive counterclaim under Rule 13(b) (though it might also be characterized as an added claim under Rule 18(a)). There could be jurisdictional problems with it, but there\u2019s none under the joinder rules. An unrelated claim against an opposing party may be asserted under Rule 13(b). ", "C is tricky. Jasper\u2019s claim for the value of his work on the code arises from the same events as the main claim. His other claim, for defamation based on Holmes\u2019s complaints about his work, is less clear, though it arguably could be held to arise from the same events. It\u2019s close; it doesn\u2019t arise directly from the contract, but from Holmes\u2019s reaction to the quality of the contract work. But we don\u2019t have to decide whether it arises from the same transaction or occurrence or not. Even if both do, Jasper doesn\u2019t have to assert them in this action. Rule 14(a)(2)(D) allows, but does not require a third-party defendant to assert claims he has against the plaintiff, even if they do arise from the same events. Neither of Jasper\u2019s claims is compulsory. ", "As the diagram shows, Holmes sued Clear Code, which impleaded Jasper. Jasper asserted two claims against the plaintiff, two back against Clear Code, and one against High Tech, which, until then, was not a party to the action. D suggests that Jasper can\u2019t assert this claim against High Tech, because only an original defendant can implead a party. However, Rule 14(a)(5) authorizes a third-party defendant to implead another party (called a fourth-party defendant) who may be liable to him for all or part of the defendant\u2019s claim against him. Again, the rule restricts the right to implead to derivative liability situations, but that\u2019s what Jasper has alleged: that if he is held liable because the code was defective, he can pass on the liability to High Tech. ", "First let\u2019s dispose of C, which is based on the misconception that the court can hear a claim, whether or not it is authorized by the supplemental jurisdiction statute, if it meets the Gibbs test for a single constitutional case. This doesn\u2019t pass muster. For the court to hear the claim, it must be within the constitutional grant of jurisdiction over related claims, expounded in Gibbs, and Congress must convey that jurisdiction to the federal district courts by statute. Both Kroger and Finley reminded us of that. For statutory authorization, we look to \u00a71367. If it doesn\u2019t authorize the court to hear the claim, it can\u2019t be heard (absent some special statute authorizing it). ", "Certainly, jurisdiction over Cavers\u2019s claim is authorized by \u00a71367(a), since it arises from the same set of facts\u2014his discharge\u2014as the main claim. But is it barred by the \u00a71367(b) exceptions? No, it isn\u2019t, because this is not a diversity case. Section 1367(b) limits certain claims by plaintiffs in diversity cases. That subsection is irrelevant if the federal court has \u2018\u2018original jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 over the main claim (Cavers\u2019s claim against Pariah) based on some other category of federal jurisdiction, as it does here. This case arises under federal law, so, even though Cavers\u2019s claim, like Mrs. Kroger\u2019s against Owen Equipment, is brought by a plaintiff against a party brought in under Rule 14, the exceptions in \u00a71367(b) are simply irrelevant. This is so, even though Cavers and Pariah (the original parties to the case) are diverse. The limits in \u00a71367(b) only apply to cases in which the federal court\u2019s original jurisdiction is \u2018\u2018founded solely on \u00a71332.\u2019\u2019 That provision doesn\u2019t apply in this case, since the federal court has original jurisdiction based on the federal ADEA claim. ", "A is also off the mark. It states that \u00a71367(a) authorizes supplemental jurisdiction, but that \u00a71367(b) takes it away. But none of the exceptions in \u00a71367(b) expressly applies. Westford\u2019s claim is a \u2018\u2018claim by [a] plaintiff,\u2019\u2019 but it is not \u2018\u2018against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24.\u2019\u2019 Rule 20 would apply if there were multiple defendants, since it applies to claims against parties joined under Rule 20. But it doesn\u2019t seem to apply where there is only one defendant. So none of the exceptions in \u00a71367(b) bars this claim, on a plain reading of the statute. If Congress meant to perpetuate the rule that each plaintiff must meet the amount in controversy requirement separately, it could have included an exception in \u00a71367(b) for \u2018\u2018claims by plaintiffs joined under Rule 20 that do not meet the amount in controversy requirement,\u2019\u2019 or similar language. It didn\u2019t. ", "This question simply requires you to compare Patterson\u2019s allegations with the defendant\u2019s responses, and apply the provisions of Rule 8 as to the effect of a denial, failure to deny, or allegation that the pleader is \u2018\u2018without sufficient facts to form a belief.\u2019\u2019 (Remember, my questions assume that you have the Rule in front of you. I\u2019m not testing whether you remember the provisions of the rule, though your professor might. Rather, the questions test whether you can apply the rules to these allegations and responses.) Naturally, AE has admitted that Adair was its employee, by admitting it! (Sometimes even the pleading rules are commonsensical.) The allegation that Adair was talking on his cell phone is treated as denied: Under the Rule 8(b)(5), the \u2018\u2018without sufficient information\u2019\u2019 response is treated as a denial. Adair hasn\u2019t responded at all to the allegation that Adair acted in the scope of employment at the time of the accident. Frequently, defendants would like to ignore allegations in the complaint, if they aren\u2019t sure of their truth, or it would be awkward to admit them. But this head-in-the-sand strategy doesn\u2019t work under the Rules: Rule 8(b)(6) provides that allegations that are not denied are deemed admitted. So, effectively, AE has admitted that Adair was its employee and that he acted in the scope of employment, but denied negligence and that Adair was chatting on the cell phone. So, B is right.", "A is an interesting suggestion. The rules expressly allow the parties to take different positions\u2014where they don\u2019t know the true facts\u2014 \u2018\u2018regardless of consistency.\u2019\u2019 So, if you have some evidence suggesting that the allegation is true, and some suggesting that it is false, why not admit and deny? It\u2019s hard to plead more honestly than that! Of course, the defendant presumably does not want to admit that Adair acted in the scope of employment. So the fact that it would be permissible to take inconsistent positions isn\u2019t the end of the matter . . . must the defendant do so? Certainly not. A pleader decides what defenses she wishes to raise, from those permissible under the rules. Because AE has evidentiary support for the position that Adair did not act in the scope of his employment, a denial is proper. AE has grounds to admit it too, since they have some evidence of that as well, but clearly doesn\u2019t want to raise that as a \u2018\u2018defense\u2019\u2019 and isn\u2019t required to. ", "B also falls short. Rule 8 requires the pleader to admit or deny the allegations, or state that she is without sufficient information. Further, Rule 8(b)(6) provides that allegations that are not denied in the answer are admitted. So ignoring the allegation would be ill advised. ", "This is a nice question. Clearly, AE doesn\u2019t want to admit that Adair acted in the scope of employment, but it does have some evidence tending to support that position. What should it do? C is \u2018\u2018wrongest.\u2019\u2019 Rule 8(b)(5) provides that, where a party pleads that it doesn\u2019t have enough information to admit or deny, that response \u2018\u2018has the effect of a denial.\u2019\u2019 (If this \u2018\u2018I dunno\u2019\u2019 response were treated as an admission, parties would rarely use it.) Basically, this response keeps the defendant\u2019s options open to develop evidence that Adair was not in the scope of employment, without having to explicitly take that position in the answer before it has fully developed its case. Because the Rules treat this response as a denial, C is wrong. AE has not admitted the allegation, and may still try to disprove the scope-of-employment allegation. ", "B is the better answer. While the amendment could relate back, it doesn\u2019t here, because White was not on notice that the action should have been filed against him. He knew that Black had been sued, but the question does not indicate that he understood that the suit was by Williams, or that it was for an arrest White had made. Thus, he is unaware, as Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) requires, that, \u2018\u2018but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity,\u2019\u2019 the action would have been brought against him. This is a nice example of the difference between the \u2018\u2018best\u2019\u2019 answer and the \u2018\u2018right\u2019\u2019 answer. A is arguably right\u2014the amendment will not relate back\u2014but B is tighter, more precise in reflecting the logic for that result. A good many professors would consider this question fair for that reason.", "C suggests that the amendment to add White will relate back, because White knew, within the limitations period for Williams\u2019s claim, that Black had been sued. But that isn\u2019t enough under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) either. The rule requires that White receive, within the limitation period (plus the 90 days for service of the complaint), \u2018\u2018such notice of the action that [White] will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits. . . .\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). Knowledge that someone has sued Black for excessive force is hardly the equivalent of notice that Williams had mistakenly sued Black for the arrest made by White. The question indicates that other officers were not aware of the particular circumstances, so it is unlikely that White was on notice that Black had been sued for an arrest he (White) had made. Unless Williams could show that it would be clear to White that the suit must be for his arrest of Williams, so that, \u2018\u2018but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party\u2019\u2019 he would have been the defendant, White doesn\u2019t have the notice called for by Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). ", "D takes the position that the amended complaint will relate back, since it arises from the same arrest. This is wrong, because Rule 15(c)(1) (C) provides that the amendment will only relate back if that is true and the two further requirements in Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i) and 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) are met. ", "D is contradicted by Rule 11(c)(3), which clearly allows a federal judge to initiate sanctions on his or her own, even though no party has moved for sanctions. Surely this is appropriate. Frivolous papers are an affront to the court and a waste of its time as well as that of the parties. The court has the power to sanction them whether a party has requested it to do so or not. ", "Let\u2019s work through them in order. A is not authorized by Rule 11: His Honor has sanctioned the client for a legal position asserted by her counsel. Rule 11(c)(5)(A) bars this. The logic for this is not far to seek. It is the lawyers who determine what legal positions to assert in a pleading; the clients know little or nothing about it and rely on counsel to do this. Consequently, it is the lawyers who take the risk of sanctions for asserting frivolous legal claims. ", "B is a proper order. Rule 11(c)(1) provides that, \u2018\u2018absent exceptional circumstances,\u2019\u2019 a law firm is jointly liable with the offending pleader for Rule 11 sanctions. Hopefully, this provision creates an incentive for other members of the firm to oversee its litigators\u2019 filings, and an incentive for the filing lawyer not to go over the line and put her partners on the hook, too. ", "Let\u2019s deal first with a major source of confusion illustrated by A. A defendant does not waive objections to personal jurisdiction by removing a case to federal court. When sued in a state court, the defendant has only thirty days to remove. He can\u2019t wait for the state court to rule on an objection to personal jurisdiction, and then remove if he loses on it. He has to remove right away, before the issue is likely to be decided by the state court. Suppose the defendant reasons as follows: \u2018\u2018I think the Utah court lacks personal jurisdiction over me for this claim. I\u2019d like to get the case dismissed on that ground. But if the court doesn\u2019t agree that it lacks jurisdiction, I\u2019d rather litigate this case in federal court.\u2019\u2019 If this is the defendant\u2019s thinking, he has to remove, doesn\u2019t he, since the state court is unlikely to rule on the personal jurisdiction question in the first thirty days? It would be a tough rule that tells this defendant: \u2018\u2018remove if you like, but if you do you are consenting to suit in this state.\u2019\u2019 The rules don\u2019t put a defendant to this choice, because he does not waive his objection to personal jurisdiction in Utah by removing; he simply changes the court in which the question will be decided. After removal, the Utah federal court, instead of the state court, will decide whether the defendant is subject to jurisdiction in Utah. So A is wrong. ", "So B is probably right. Hue waived the objection before removing. Since the objection was waived before removal, it can\u2019t be revived by removal. It makes no difference that he could have raised both defenses together in federal court (D). He certainly could have done that, if he had responded in federal court under Rule 12. But he didn\u2019t respond in federal court; he responded in state court, and state procedure applies until the case is removed. A caveat is in order here. I\u2019ve had some battles with a colleague over this one. He argues that the objection is not waived, since no decision was made in state court before removal that Hue had waived his objection. In his view, when the motion is renewed in federal court, the federal court should apply federal standards. Send me your thoughts. Here\u2019s another question to clarify the point.", "C is another loser. It suggests that the objection is still valid because under federal procedure it can be asserted in the answer. But state procedure applies until removal, and under this state\u2019s procedure (the example indicates) you waive your objection by appearing in the action and failing to confine your objection to the lack of personal jurisdiction. And that\u2019s what Hue did here. He appeared, in a state that uses the special appearance approach to jurisdictional objections, and raised a defense of failure to state a claim along with his objection to personal jurisdiction. Big mistake! In states that adhere to the traditional special appearance approach, this constitutes a general appearance and waives the objection to jurisdiction. ", "Since the objection was waived before removal, it can\u2019t be revived by removal. It makes no difference that he could have raised both defenses together in federal court (D). He certainly could have done that, if he had responded in federal court under Rule 12.

", "", "The other choices consider whether Rule 26(b)(3) protects the witness statement from discovery. D takes the view that it must be produced under Rule 26(b)(3)(C), which deals specifically with witness statements. This is too loose a reading of the subsection, however. This provision allows a party to obtain her own statement about the case. It also allows a nonparty to obtain her own statement. It does not apply where a party seeks a statement of a nonparty. ", "A is not right. The attorney-client privilege extends to communications between lawyer and client, but here the witness is not the client or even the employee of a client. If the information sought is protected, it will have to be under the work product doctrine, not attorney-client privilege. But Rule 26(b)(3), by its terms, does not provide such protection. It extends work product protection to \u2018\u2018documents and tangible things.\u2019\u2019 The questions here seek oral testimony concerning Sanders\u2019s conversations with Marathon\u2019s counsel, so the rule does not apply. B is wrong. Although Rule 26(b)(3) doesn\u2019t apply, E, which takes the position that the objection should be overruled, is not the best answer either. The case law has held that Rule 26(b)(3) has partially codified the work product protection recognized in Hickman. It governs where the material sought to be protected is found in documents or tangible things. But, where similar work product information not included in a document or tangible thing is sought, the cases look back to Hickman and extend similar protection to the material. In other words, Rule 26(b)(3) is not the exclusive source of work product protection. Attorneys\u2019 mental processes can still be protected under the common law protection stemming from Hickman as well. ", "C doesn\u2019t cut the mustard either. The courts have generally taken the position that Maurice must seek more than $75,000 against Parker to meet the amount requirement.2 He can\u2019t bootstrap a claim against Parker for less than the required amount onto his claim against O\u2019Connell for more. ", "Let\u2019s review the choices in reverse order. D is wrong, because Maurice does meet the amount requirement against O\u2019Connell. One plaintiff can add up whatever claims he asserts against a particular defendant to meet the amount requirement, so Maurice can add his $25,000 and $65,000 claims against O\u2019Connell to meet the requirement. ", "A isn\u2019t right because the amount requirement is not met by either plaintiff, and they can\u2019t be added together. ", "B is no good either. The amount requirement must be assessed based only on the plaintiff\u2019s claim, without regard to the value of any counterclaim. If Curly had brought the initial suit (and the claim for $100,000 were colorable), the court would have had jurisdiction. But Larry brought it, and sues for less, so his claim does not support original jurisdiction. ", "The claims in C do satisfy the amount requirement, however. Here, either defendant might be found to have negligently caused Larry\u2019s injuries, so either might be liable for his full $100,000 in damages. Go with C.", "E is a clear loser, because Rule 26(b)(5)(B) expressly applies to inadvertent disclosure of \u2018\u2018trial preparation material\u2019\u2019 as well as claims of privilege.

On this logic, A is the best answer.", "If Roh does not appear at trial, cross-examining at the deposition will be the only opportunity Czonka\u2019s counsel has to cross- examine Roh under oath. She had better do it as well as she can. Czonka\u2019s counsel could move for a protective order postponing the deposition till later in discovery, as B suggests. But she isn\u2019t likely to succeed if Roh is about to leave the country. Once he\u2019s gone, he\u2019s gone. He no longer works for NorthStar, so it could not make him return for trial. Consequently, the judge is not likely to prevent the taking of his deposition, even though it leaves Czonka at a disadvantage.", "But C is wrong here, because the deposition is being taken to perpetuate the witness\u2019s testimony for trial, not to obtain information. ", "A indicates that, since Maxwell would be \u2018\u2018entitled to judgment as a matter of law,\u2019\u2019 the judge should enter judgment for Maxwell for the damages he seeks in the complaint. However, Maxwell would not automatically win the entire case if the contract is valid. He would still have to establish that he had performed under the contract in order to recover the price of the work. The judge could grant partial summary judgment, establishing that the contract is valid. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(g). However, since the issue of whether Maxwell performed the contract would still be in dispute, she could not enter judgment on the entire case for Maxwell. ", "B is wrong too. It indicates that, if the judge concludes that the writing does not constitute a valid contract, she should enter judgment for Chao, dismissing the complaint. However, Maxwell has also sought quantum meruit recovery in the other count of his complaint, which he could recover even if the contract is not enforceable. So his case should not be dismissed, even if his count based on the written contract is. ", "C focuses on Chao\u2019s failure to submit opposing evidence. Rule 56 usually requires the party opposing summary judgment to submit supporting evidentiary materials, to convince the judge that there is a factual issue to be tried. Here, however, Chao does not disagree with the facts set forth by Maxwell in support of the motion. He agrees that the note is the only writing evidencing the contract, but takes the position that, as a matter of law, it is insufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds. In effect, he admits that there is \u2018\u2018no genuine dispute of material fact\u2019\u2019 about the writing, but takes the position that Maxwell is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, since the writing he has produced doesn\u2019t satisfy the statute of frauds. This is permissible under Rule 56. Indeed, summary judgment provides an excellent vehicle for resolving cases in which the parties\u2019 disagreement is not about the facts themselves, but about the legal effect of the facts. Chao might well have made a cross- motion for summary judgment here, arguing that she is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, because the note is insufficient to evidence a contract. If the judge agreed, she could grant judgment for Chao on the written-contract claim, since Maxwell could not win on it if the writing is insufficient. ", "So, D takes the prize. If the judge concludes that the note suffices as a writing, she should grant partial summary judgment for Maxwell on the issue of the sufficiency of the note as a contract. But she would not enter judgment for Maxwell on the claim as a whole, because his motion only establishes one element of the claim, existence of the contract. Maxwell still has to establish other elements of the contract claim (such as adequate performance) or the quantum meruit claim, in order to recover from Chao.", "So B is the right answer here; the motion will be denied based on Colon\u2019s failure to raise this challenge to Uberoth\u2019s proof before the case went to the jury. ", "It suggests that the judge, by denying the earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law, has determined that Uberoth\u2019s evidence is sufficient, so this issue is settled. The fact that the judge denies a motion for a directed verdict does not always mean that she has concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s case is adequately supported by the evidence. It may simply mean that she is reserving judgment, perhaps hoping that the jury will settle the issue by finding for the defendant. The very point of Rule 50(b) is that the denial of a prior motion under Rule 50(a) does not inevitably mean that the judge considers the evidence sufficient. It may simply reflect her desire to \u2018\u2018save the trial\u2019\u2019 by ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence after the verdict rather than before. The right answer here flows from the rationale for the Rule 50(b) requirement that the motion for judgment be made before the case goes to the jury, in order to preserve the right to seek judgment notwithstanding the verdict after a verdict. Here, Colon moved for a directed verdict before the case went to the jury, on the ground that the evidence did not show that he knew that the statements he made about the investment were false. This motion put Uberoth on notice of a possible weakness in his proof of this element of his case. If he had further evidence about Colon\u2019s knowledge that the statements were false, he could ask the court to allow him to reopen his case, and submit that proof. But the motion on this ground did not put Uberoth on notice that his proof of reliance, a separate element, was inadequate. When Colon moves for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on this ground, the challenge comes out of the blue, at a time when Uberoth can no longer do anything about it. In the language of poker, Colon has \u2018\u2018sandbagged\u2019\u2019 Uberoth by keeping this objection in his back pocket, letting the case go to the jury and raising the reliance issue after the jury\u2019s verdict, when it is too late to offer any further evidence of reliance. Of course, it\u2019s true that it\u2019s Uberoth\u2019s case to prove. He should know the elements of a claim for fraud, and assumes the responsibility of proving them at trial. If he hasn\u2019t proven one of them, perhaps he should take the consequences. But the point of the Rule 50(b) requirement of a prior Rule 50(a) motion is to put him on notice of the defect before the case goes to the jury, and Colon didn\u2019t put him on notice of the defect in proof of reliance at that point. It is not enough that he moved for judgment as a matter of law on some ground to preserve his right to judgment as a matter of law after the verdict. His motion must raise the objection he renews in the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. ", "Although D seems like it should be right, Colon will have forfeited his right to judgment on this ground by failing to raise it before the case goes to the jury. This is one more illustration of a basic point: procedure matters. ", "both orders are appealable. That\u2019s the reason for having the trial judge make both rulings, so that the appellate court can review both and properly dispose of the case. Even though the ruling on the new trial is \u2018\u2018conditional,\u2019\u2019 that is, it will only take effect if the grant of judgment as a matter of law is reversed, that ruling is still reviewable. If the appellate court reverses the entry of judgment for Orwell under Rule 50(b), it can then decide whether the motion for new trial was appropriately granted. Thus, B fails as well. Both orders are appealable. If the appellate court concludes (after reversing the judgment for Orwell) that the new trial was properly granted, it will remand for the new trial. If the court concludes that this motion also should not have been granted, it will reverse the new trial order too, and order entry of judgment for Parkins on the jury\u2019s verdict.", "The crux of the matter here is that the judge has granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law. She has concluded that the evidence is too weak to support a verdict for Parkins. Consequently, Orwell is the winner. Judgment should enter for him. But Rule 50(c)(1) tells the trial judge not to leave it at that, to rule \u2018\u2018conditionally\u2019\u2019 on the motion for a new trial too. When the judge does that, she is saying, \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve taken the verdict away from Parkins and ordered judgment entered for Orwell, because the evidence is too weak to support a rational verdict for Parkins. So I\u2019m granting judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) for Orwell. Rule 50(c)(1) tells me I have to rule on the new trial motion too, so I\u2019m stating that, if the appellate court reverses my Rule 50(b) ruling, I would grant a new trial in this case, because the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence.\u2019\u2019 Fine, but where does the case go from there? C is wrong, because Rule 50(c)(2) provides that a conditional grant of a new trial \u2018\u2018does not affect the judgment\u2019s finality.\u2019\u2019 The judge has ordered final judgment entered for the defendant, and that will happen. The case is over in the trial court. If no appeal is taken, the judgment for Orwell will stand as the final adjudication of the case. True, the judge has said that, if her order is overturned, there should be a new trial, but only if the order is overturned on appeal. ", "D is wrong, because both orders are appealable. That\u2019s the reason for having the trial judge make both rulings, so that the appellate court can review both and properly dispose of the case. Even though the ruling on the new trial is \u2018\u2018conditional,\u2019\u2019 that is, it will only take effect if the grant of judgment as a matter of law is reversed, that ruling is still reviewable. If the appellate court reverses the entry of judgment for Orwell under Rule 50(b), it can then decide whether the motion for new trial was appropriately granted.", "In his original action, Pelham sued in federal court, and left out the state law claims for assault and battery. When he sues again in Emporia state court, that court must determine whether Pelham could have brought a second action on those claims in federal court, the court that rendered the judgment. Here, he could not have brought a second federal court action. The federal courts follow the Second Restatement\u2019s transactional approach to preclusion. Under that approach, the assault and battery claims will be barred if they arise from the same events as the federal civil rights claim and could have been brought in the first suit. B suggests that a second action should be allowed because these state law claims could not have been asserted in the federal suit. However, they could have been asserted there: His assault and battery claims would have been proper supplemental claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a), since they arise from the same events as his federal civil rights claim. Thus, B fails. Since the two state law claims could have been asserted in the first action, they would be barred under the Second Restatement approach to claim preclusion.", "C is the best answer: Pelham will be barred, under federal preclusion law, because the assault and battery claims arise from the same arrest as the civil rights claim. Because he could have joined those supplemental claims in the first action and didn\u2019t, he is barred from raising them in a second suit. Of course, a federal court has discretion under the supplemental jurisdiction statute to entertain or dismiss supplemental claims. Isn\u2019t it possible that, if Pelham had asserted these claims in federal court, the court would have declined the invitation to hear them? Yes, that is possible, but by failing to present the claims in Suit One, Pelham has denied the court the opportunity to litigate the entire controversy in one action. Res judicata will apply. Had Pelham asserted his assault and battery claims in the first suit, and the federal court decided, in its discretion, to dismiss them, Pelham would have been allowed to bring a second action in state court on those claims. At that point, the principle we started with, that a party is not precluded from later asserting a claim that could not be heard in the first action, would apply.", "D also fails, because the Emporia court will not ask whether Emporia\u2019s res judicata principles would bar a second action, but rather whether federal res judicata principles would. Once again, the second court, even in a different state or a different court system, will usually look to the preclusion principles of the rendering court, not its own. Since Pelham could not have brought a second action in federal court, under our \u2018\u2018working rule\u2019\u2019 that the second court looks to the preclusion law of the first, he cannot bring it in state court either. ", "So we know what they decided on each of these issues. Which of these findings was necessary to the judgment? They all were. The jury had to reject all three defenses in order to render a verdict for Perez. They couldn\u2019t find for Perez without rejecting all three defenses. If, for example, they had found that the mayor had not believed that Perez had supported Appolonia, they would not have awarded damages for violation of his First Amendment rights in demoting him for it. Consequently, their finding on this issue was necessary to the outcome in the first suit. And the same is true of the other two defenses. Thus, C is wrong, because, if the jury had reached a different result on any one of these three defenses, the City would have won. But it didn\u2019t, so the jury must have rejected them all, and rejecting all three led to the verdict they returned. Here, it\u2019s B as in \u2018\u2018Best.\u2019\u2019", "A suggests that Carmichael is barred because he should have joined as a coplaintiff with Gotschall. However, while Rule 20(a) would allow him to join in that suit, it does not require him to do so; Rule 20(a) is permissive. (In fact there might be various reasons why Carmichael could not have joined, such as diversity problems.) More practically, who says he even knew about Gotschall\u2019s action? It would be a tough rule that forced him to join even though he never learned of the other case! ", "B argues that he is barred because the requirements for collateral estoppel are met\u2014the issue is the same, it was actually litigated in suit one and decided by the court. All that is true . . . but it was not litigated by Carmichael. Due process of law requires that he have his bite at the apple before he is estopped on the issue, and he hasn\u2019t had it. This is indeed a \u2018\u2018first principle\u2019\u2019: No party will be estopped (absent some form of privity) until she has had her day in court. My students frequently lose sight of this fundamental, ineluctable requirement for applying issue preclusion. Always ask whether the party who is being barred from litigating the issue litigated it before. If not, no estoppel! Estoppel\u2014in a mutuality jurisdiction or in a non-mutuality jurisdiction\u2014only bars a party from relitigating an issue, not from litigating it for the first time. ", "Scratch C from the beginning. The finding that the brochure did not promise a particular rate of return was necessary to the judgment. Gotschall based his claim on the fact that the brochure promised a 15 percent return, and he lost his case because the judge found that the brochure did not promise a specific rate of return, so that finding of fact did lead to the judgment. It was not dicta; it was the very basis for the decision that Gotschall could not recover. ", "So D is the best answer. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim, because it arises from the same underlying dispute as the ADEA claim. But the misappropriation claim arises from other, only tangentially related events, and would not qualify under \u00a71367 (or under U.M.W. v. Gibbs) for supplemental jurisdiction.", "A suggests that the court can retain the case if it \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law as that phrase is used in Article III, \u00a72, even if \u00a71331 doesn\u2019t authorize federal jurisdiction over it. I suppose the logic here is that, as long as it would not offend constitutional limits for the federal court to hear the case, it has the power to do so, even if the case does not satisfy Congress\u2019s statutory limits on arising-under jurisdiction. However, a federal court exceeds its authority when it exercises jurisdiction that Congress has not granted, just as it would if it exercised jurisdiction not within the constitutional grant. So, the court will dismiss a case that is not authorized by statute, as well as one that goes beyond the Article III constitutional grant. ", "So B, then, is the best answer. To avoid exceeding the limits on its jurisdictional competence, the federal court will dismiss if it determines that it lacks jurisdiction, despite Taney\u2019s failure to raise the objection earlier.", "C seems like a pretty reasonable answer here. Why should Taney, who invoked the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction, be allowed to challenge it when the case looks as though it may be going sour? Isn\u2019t he manipulating the system, and shouldn\u2019t he be estopped from denying jurisdiction, in order to discourage such manipulation? There\u2019s a fair argument for that view, but other considerations outweigh the risk of manipulation. Federal subject matter jurisdiction involves more than the interests of the parties. It implicates the constitutional balance between the federal and state governments. In order to assure that federal courts don\u2019t exceed their constitutional authority, they will always entertain a challenge to their subject matter jurisdiction. After all, if the federal court exercises jurisdiction over a case it lacks the power to hear, the resulting judgment will be subject to reversal on appeal, since a judgment rendered without the power to enter it is invalid. To avoid such wasteful and unconstitutional exercises, the trial court will always consider challenges to its jurisdiction. \u2018\u2018If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).", "This reasoning disposes of D as well. The objection of lack of subject matter jurisdiction is never waived\u2014at least, it remains subject to direct attack on appeal, even if no objection was raised in the trial court. In Mottley, for example, the issue was raised by the Supreme Court itself. Federal Rule 12(h)(3) confirms that this is true throughout the litigation in the trial court, even if it is the plaintiff who raises the problem. Consider what would happen if the rule were otherwise: Suppose that the parties wanted to litigate a case in federal court that did not satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiff could file suit in federal court, and the defendant could simply fail to object. If such a failure to raise jurisdictional defects authorized the federal court to hear the case, the parties could evade the constitutional limits on federal judicial power. Of course, the federal judge might note the lack of jurisdiction on her own motion, and dismiss, but the limits on federal judicial power should not be left to discretion or to chance.3 So Taney has not waived the right to make the motion by failing to raise the jurisdiction issue earlier. ", "", "A is very tempting. It is true that objections to federal subject matter jurisdiction don\u2019t have to be raised within the thirty-day period for objections to removal. See \u00a71447(c) (objections \u2018\u2018other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 must be made within thirty days after filing of the notice of removal). But the amount-in-controversy requirement is met here. Tyrgyz claims that either Boch or Ivens caused his injury, he doesn\u2019t know which. So there is a legitimate claim for that amount against each. See Chapter 2, pp. 21-22. If the jury concludes that Boch caused the harm, he could be held liable for $120,000. If it concludes that Ivens caused it, she will. If it concludes that neither is liable, Tyrgyz will lose. But he still has asserted a colorable claim for $120,000 against each defendant, and might recover that amount from either. So A is wrong. ", "B is also quite credible. Ivens didn\u2019t join in the notice of removal, and under \u00a71446(b)(2)(a) the case can\u2019t be heard in federal court if Ivens doesn\u2019t agree to the removal. The problem is that no one moved to remand the case within the thirty-day window for motions to remand based on objections other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Ivens\u2019s failure to join is a defect, but not a jurisdictional defect. The case is a proper diversity case, whether Ivens joins in the notice of removal or not. So Ivens has waived her objection to removal if she doesn\u2019t move to remand within thirty days. That\u2019s the effect of \u00a71447(c)\u2019s requirement that a motion to remand based on any problem with the removal\u2014other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction\u2014be made within thirty days. If no motion is made, the objection is waived.", "So C takes the prize. ", "E is not right. Glannon thinks he does know the best answer here (as always!) and your professor will think she does as well. ", "A, of course, is a throwaway. A defendant can establish contacts that give rise to litigation in the course of a short visit to a state or without visiting it at all. Consider a defendant who makes a single defamatory phone call to a newspaper in Tennessee, leading to a story in a Tennessee newspaper that damages a Tennessee resident\u2019s reputation. This act would clearly support specific in personam jurisdiction for claims for the defamation. ", "Wouldn\u2019t we all like to choose B in this example? It will be massively inconvenient for Mary to defend this action in California, so doesn\u2019t it offend due process to make her do so? Almost certainly not. Mary went to California, engaged in risk-creating conduct there by driving, and that conduct gave rise to Exxon Mobil\u2019s claim against her. As to the reasonableness of the California forum, most factors favor suit in California: Most of the evidence and the witnesses will probably be in California; the plaintiff is there; the truck is there. Although it will be inconvenient for Mary to litigate in California, she did choose to go there and caused the accident there (allegedly). A procedure that requires her to defend her California conduct in a California court hardly reflects a lack of due process under the International Shoe line of cases. Although one has sympathy for Mary and perhaps little for her opponent, this worthy sentiment is almost certainly insufficient to defeat California jurisdiction under minimum contacts analysis. It is indeed a cold, cruel world. ", "C suggests that a defendant can avoid personal jurisdiction in a state by arguing that it would be more convenient for the plaintiff to come to her than for her to go to the defendant. This comparative balancing analysis isn\u2019t supported by the Supreme Court\u2019s cases on personal jurisdiction, although occasionally \u2018\u2018inconvenience\u2019\u2019 goes into the analysis. The Court\u2019s cases ask whether the plaintiff has chosen a forum that is acceptable under due process analysis, given the defendant\u2019s contacts and a number of reasonableness factors, not whether an alternative forum would be more convenient for the defendant than the one the plaintiff has chosen. ", "In his majority opinion, Justice Marshall suggested that exercises of in rem jurisdiction would have to be measured by the same standards as exercises of in personam jurisdiction. Thus, attachment jurisdiction is not dead. It is constitutionally permissible for a court to exercise jurisdiction based on an attachment . . . if it could assert jurisdiction over the defendant personally for the claim plaintiff seeks to adjudicate. So, to decide whether the above in rem cases are still permissible, we must ask whether the plaintiff could have sued the defendant for the same claim in an in personam action. In A, the plaintiff was injured on the defendant\u2019s property and seeks to recover for the injury. This claim arises out of the ownership and maintenance of real property in the state. Since it arises from a significant in-state contact of Roux in Nebraska\u2014maintenance of his property there\u2014he could be sued for it in Nebraska based on specific in personam jurisdiction. Thus, this exercise of jurisdiction meets International Shoe jurisdictional standards, and Ohora may proceed by attaching the property under an attachment statute if she chooses to do so. In Shaffer, Justice Marshall notes that the minimum contacts test will usually be met in such cases. See 433 U.S. at 208. One might legitimately wonder why Ohora would choose to proceed by attachment, which only brings the defendant\u2019s property before the court, rather than suing Roux in personam, which would support a personal judgment for the full amount of Ohora\u2019s injuries. Presumably, Ohora would sue in personam in most cases. She might proceed by attachment, however, if the state long-arm statute did not authorize personal jurisdiction under the circumstances, yet the attachment statute authorized attachment of the defendant\u2019s in-state assets. For an example of such a case, see Intermeat Inc. v. American Poultry Inc., 575 F.2d 1017 (2d Cir. 1978). ", "B is a \u2018\u2018pure\u2019\u2019 in rem action to quiet title to real property. Under the broad holding of the Shaffer majority, such actions would have to meet the personal jurisdiction standards of International Shoe. And they usually would, since the suit involves title to property within the forum state. Because it arises from ownership of an interest in land in Nebraska, claimants to the property will have a minimum contact in Nebraska that gives rise to the claim. Since the court could proceed in personam, it may proceed based on jurisdiction over the property instead. This one is OK. The trend seems pretty clear here, doesn\u2019t it. ", "C is an exercise of quasi in rem type I jurisdiction. Here again, the claim is to property present in the forum. Since the case involves conflicting ownership interests in property in Nebraska, the court would quite likely have jurisdiction over the claimants under the minimum contacts test. ", "Choice C is tempting but incorrect. Under Federal Rule 4(k)(1)(A) the court indeed will ask whether it would be constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to exercise jurisdiction over Jason. But it will also ask whether Arizona\u2019s long-arm statute has authorized its courts to exercise jurisdiction in the circumstances of Argo\u2019s case. So this choice is incomplete. ", "D is a nonstarter as well. It takes the broad position that, because the federal court could constitutionally exercise jurisdiction based on minimum contacts anywhere in the United States, the court has jurisdiction here. But, not to beat a dead myrmidon,9 the fact that the federal court has constitutional power to exercise personal jurisdiction over Jason is only one step of the analysis. Jurisdiction must also be authorized by statute (or, in this case, by a Rule promulgated pursuant to statutory authority). We still have to look at Rule 4(k)(1)(A) to determine whether the federal court has been authorized to hear the case. ", "Rule 4(k)(1)(A) applies to cases removed to federal court as well as to cases filed there originally. Generally, under that rule, the court may exercise jurisdiction if the courts of the state in which the federal court sits could do so. As was pointed out in the removal chapter (see pp. 64-66), removing a case to federal court does not waive the right to object to personal jurisdiction. It simply changes the court in which the objection will be raised. Jason may remove and then move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Arizona federal court will then determine whether it has statutory and constitutional authority to exercise jurisdiction over him. So E here is a nonstarter. ", "A has a slight patina of credibility. We saw earlier that a party who litigated and lost on jurisdiction has a right to appeal that issue and try to get it reversed. But that right allows Ito to appeal the Emporia trial judge\u2019s ruling to an Emporia appellate court, not save it up and appeal it in the enforcing court. If a judge in an Emporia court makes an incorrect finding, the Emporia court system is the one to correct it; the Acadia appellate courts have no authority to review rulings of the Emporia trial courts. (Imagine what a mess it would be if New York appellate judges started reviewing the rulings of California trial judges. We\u2019d have just the type of internecine strife that the Full Faith and Credit Clause was meant to avert.) ", "B is right; since Ito appeared and litigated whether the Emporia court had jurisdiction over him in the Emporia action, the Acadia court will estop him from litigating that issue again when Ervin sues to enforce the judgment. Once is enough; if Ito really wants to litigate the jurisdiction issue in an Acadia court, he\u2019s going to have to default in Emporia\u2014a huge price to pay\u2014to preserve his right to do so.", "C isn\u2019t right either. While it is generally true that a defendant may challenge jurisdiction \u2018\u2018collaterally\u2019\u2019 in the enforcing court, she may not do so if she appeared and litigated the issue in the original action, as Ito did in this example. Civil procedure has a vexing doctrine called \u2018\u2018collateral estoppel\u2019\u2019 that bars parties from relitigating issues that were litigated and resolved between them in a prior proceeding. ", "He has been sloppy in B as well. A waiver is not obtained by sending a request for it, even if it includes all the information required in Rule 4(d)(1). A waiver is obtained when the defendant signs and returns the waiver form. Nothing indicates that Lorenzo did that in B.", "In C, Darrow sent a proper request for waiver, with the complaint, and got it back signed. But he didn\u2019t send a formal summons from the court. That\u2019s all right. A formal summons, signed and sealed by the clerk, is required for proper service (see Rule 4(c)(1)), but is not required for a proper waiver. The whole point is that defendant waives this formality. See Rule 4(d)(1), which provides in part that \u2018\u2018the plaintiff may . . . request that the defendant waive service of a summons.\u2019\u2019 So Lorenzo has waived service in C.", "And in D, Darrow gets back the post office receipt showing that Lorenzo got the form, but that doesn\u2019t constitute a waiver by Lorenzo. It only means that he received the request to waive service. ", "In A, service is proper on Preferred, because the summons commanding Preferred to respond was delivered to Donitz, an officer of Preferred, together with a copy of the complaint. But no summons addressed to Donitz was served on him. Even though Donitz received a summons, as well as a copy of the complaint, service here is technically deficient. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(a)(1)(B) (summons must be \u2018\u2018directed to the defendant\u2019\u2019). Donitz will know, from the complaint, that he is also a defendant, but he has not received an order from the court to appear and defend. His objection is a tad technical, but if there is one area in which the courts require dotting the \u2018\u2018i\u2019\u2019\u2019s and crossing the \u2018\u2018t\u2019\u2019\u2019s, it is likely to be initial service of process.

C is the best answer.", "Klaxon holds the key to this question. It requires the Rhode Island federal judge to do what a Rhode Island state judge would have done, had the case been filed in a Rhode Island state court. If it had been, the Rhode Island judge would have used Rhode Island\u2019s choice-of-law rules to choose between Vermont tort law (which would uphold the release) and Rhode Island tort law, which probably would not. B appears based on the premise that the Rhode Island court would apply whatever body of law would favor the resident plaintiff. But that isn\u2019t Rhode Island\u2019s choice-of-law rule. Instead, it applies the law of the state of the injury, which is Vermont in this case. Consequently, the plaintiff\u2019s rights will be decided under Vermont law, even though the case is litigated in Rhode Island. C suggests that the federal judge should use the law of the state in which the federal court sits. This also isn\u2019t accurate under Klaxon. A more accurate statement is that the Rhode Island federal judge should apply the same body of substantive law to the case that a Rhode Island state judge would apply. Often, that will be Rhode Island law. But in cases with connections to several states (which is likely to be true in many diversity cases), the federal judge must choose the law of another state, under Klaxon, if a Rhode Island judge would. So the judge in Whitney\u2019s case must look at Rhode Island\u2019s choice- of-law rule. It calls for (the question assumes) application of the law of the place of injury. That was Vermont, so we look to Vermont tort law, which enforces waivers. So A is the best answer.2 Although Rhode Island wouldn\u2019t enforce this waiver in a domestic case, its choice-of-law rule calls for application of the law of the place of injury, and that means Vermont law rather than its own. Whitney was pretty clearly ill-advised to sue at home. The combination of Rhode Island\u2019s lex loci choice of law rule and Vermont\u2019s enforcement of liability waivers leaves her client out in the cold (no pun intended). If she had sued in Vermont, Vermont might have chosen its own law under \u2018\u2018interest analysis,\u2019\u2019 but at least might have found Rhode Island\u2019s interests greater. Thus, Erie and Klaxon together suggest that lawyers should carefully consider the choice-of-law implications of the forum they choose in diversity cases.", "This is a tough case.

First, determine the nature of the conflict, then apply the relevant standard. If Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) directly conflicts with the state constitutional provision for unified trial, we ask whether it is valid. If it directly conflicts, and if it is valid, then the federal court must apply it. There seems little question that Rule 42(b) directly conflicts with Tennessee\u2019s approach. It authorizes the judge to order a separate trial of the identity issue, while Tennessee law bars a Tennessee judge from doing so. It is hard to see how the Federal Rule and the state approach can coexist. One has to be applied instead of the other. Under Hanna Part II, if Rule 42(b) is valid, it will apply in federal court. C here is tempting. How can a mere rule of procedure, even a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, preempt a constitutional provision? The answer is that federal law, if it is valid, preempts state law that contradicts it, under the Supremacy Clause, whether the preempted provision is found in a state court rule, a state statute, or a state constitution. So the question remains, is Rule 42(b) a valid exercise of the Court\u2019s rule-making power? If it is, and if it conflicts with the state approach, it will prevail. To determine whether it is valid, we apply the Hanna Part II analysis, because the federal approach is found in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. A is wrong, because the use of federal procedure here doesn\u2019t turn on the outcome-determinative test. It turns on the Court\u2019s authority to write the rule. So, it\u2019s either B, which states that the Rule is valid and applies, or D, which indicates that it would fail under the \u2018\u2018substantive rights\u2019\u2019 proviso of the REA. Very likely, Rule 42(b) would be upheld.4 Certainly, it passes the \u2018\u2018procedural\u2019\u2019 test\u2014whether it \u2018\u2018really regulates procedure\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them\u2019\u2019\u2014since it pertains directly to the conduct of trials. And it seems doubtful that the Court would conclude that it abridges a substantive right, since it is a general provision dealing with the trial process, not a regulation of primary rights and duties outside the courtroom. I go with B.", "This one desperately needs a diagram to sort out the claims: As the diagram shows, Holmes sued Clear Code, which impleaded Jasper. Jasper asserted two claims against the plaintiff, two back against Clear Code, and one against High Tech, which, until then, was not a party to the action.

Thus, A is wrong, and D is, after all is said and done, the right answer.", "This is a fairly simple case, in which one plaintiff sues the defendant on a proper diversity claim, but the other plaintiff\u2019s claim does not meet the amount in controversy requirement. The case looks like this: We know that, under the traditional \u2018\u2018aggregation rules\u2019\u2019 courts have used in assessing the amount in controversy, each plaintiff was required to meet the amount requirement individually, so that Westford\u2019s claim would not be proper. The question is whether, in enacting \u00a71367, Congress has changed the traditional rule. Let\u2019s start with B, which suggests that Westford\u2019s claim cannot be added under supplemental jurisdiction, because it is not part of the same case or controversy under \u00a71367(a). This is clearly wrong: Both plaintiffs were fired at the same time for the same conduct, so these would surely be treated as arising out of a common nucleus of operative fact. A is also off the mark. It states that \u00a71367(a) authorizes supplemental jurisdiction, but that \u00a71367(b) takes it away. But none of the exceptions in \u00a71367(b) expressly applies. Westford\u2019s claim is a \u2018\u2018claim by [a] plaintiff,\u2019\u2019 but it is not \u2018\u2018against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24.\u2019\u2019 Rule 20 would apply if there were multiple defendants, since it applies to claims against parties joined under Rule 20. But it doesn\u2019t seem to apply where there is only one defendant. So none of the exceptions in \u00a71367(b) bars this claim, on a plain reading of the statute. If Congress meant to perpetuate the rule that each plaintiff must meet the amount in controversy requirement separately, it could have included an exception in \u00a71367(b) for \u2018\u2018claims by plaintiffs joined under Rule 20 that do not meet the amount in controversy requirement,\u2019\u2019 or similar language. It didn\u2019t. But it is true, isn\u2019t it, as D suggests, that allowing it would be inconsistent with the established rules for determining the amount in controversy in a diversity case, which have always required each plaintiff to meet the amount requirement separately? Well, that is true, but Congress may change the established rules, and probably did so inadvertently by granting broad supplemental jurisdiction over related claims in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a), and failing to exclude claims such as Westford\u2019s in \u00a71367(b). In Exxon Mobil, the Supreme Court parsed the statute carefully, and concluded that\u2014whatever the drafters may have intended\u2014the text of sections 1367(a) and (b) is clear: section 1367(a) authorizes jurisdiction over all other claims that arise out of the same case or controversy. That would include Westford\u2019s claim here. And no exception to that broad grant in \u00a71367(b) bars Westford\u2019s claim. C takes the cake. Question. Ok, if you\u2019ve got that down, consider this case: Suppose that Cavers, from Wisconsin, sues Pariah Corporation for $200,000 in damages in an industrial accident, and Rolvaag joins as a coplaintiff, seeking $120,000 in damages for his injuries in the same accident. Rolvaag is from Iowa. The case looks like this: How about this argument for supplemental jurisdiction over Rolvaag\u2019s claim? The court has original jurisdiction over Cavers\u2019s claim against Pariah, since it is a diversity claim for more than $75,000. Rolvaag\u2019s claim arises out of the same \u2018\u2018case or controversy,\u2019\u2019 since he is suing for the same accident. So \u00a71367(a) authorizes supplemental jurisdiction over his claim. And nothing in \u00a71367(b) excludes the claim, since it is not one brought against a person made a party under one of the stated rules. Pretty good argument, isn\u2019t it? Perhaps, but if this argument were accepted, \u00a71367 would overrule the complete diversity requirement of Strawbridge v. Curtiss. Justice Kennedy managed to avoid that conclusion in Exxon Mobil by holding that, in a diversity case, the court does not have original jurisdiction of any claim unless there is complete diversity between all plaintiffs and defendants. So, in Cavers\u2019s and Rolvaag\u2019s case, the court has no original jurisdiction from which to hang the added claim. Note, however, that in considering the amount in controversy requirement, the Exxon Mobil court analyzes the case claim by claim, concluding that, where one plaintiff met the amount requirement, others did not have to. By this awkward parsing of the statute, Justice Kennedy managed to perpetuate the complete diversity rule. Let\u2019s try to tie this all up with a Super-Closer. Remember, Closers are optional.", "If you read the rule (or even my preface to the question), this question simply requires you to compare Patterson\u2019s allegations with the defendant\u2019s responses, and apply the provisions of Rule 8 as to the effect of a denial, failure to deny, or allegation that the pleader is \u2018\u2018without sufficient facts to form a belief.\u2019\u2019 (Remember, my questions assume that you have the Rule in front of you. I\u2019m not testing whether you remember the provisions of the rule, though your professor might. Rather, the questions test whether you can apply the rules to these allegations and responses.) Naturally, AE has admitted that Adair was its employee, by admitting it! (Sometimes even the pleading rules are commonsensical.) The allegation that Adair was talking on his cell phone is treated as denied: Under the Rule 8(b)(5), the \u2018\u2018without sufficient information\u2019\u2019 response is treated as a denial. Adair hasn\u2019t responded at all to the allegation that Adair acted in the scope of employment at the time of the accident. Frequently, defendants would like to ignore allegations in the complaint, if they aren\u2019t sure of their truth, or it would be awkward to admit them. But this head-in-the-sand strategy doesn\u2019t work under the Rules: Rule 8(b)(6) provides that allegations that are not denied are deemed admitted. So, effectively, AE has admitted that Adair was its employee and that he acted in the scope of employment, but denied negligence and that Adair was chatting on the cell phone. So, B is right. As we saw in the first part of this chapter, the Federal Rules allow the plaintiff to present as many claims as she has evidence to support, even if they can\u2019t all be true. The idea is to put the defendant on notice of the positions that you may seek to establish, not a single one you have settled on irrevocably. The same goes for the defendant. Under Rule 8, the defendant is allowed to plead whatever defenses she has to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. She may take inconsistent positions about the facts or the law, and may raise multiple defenses without choosing among them. The defendant might, for example, deny that she was negligent, but also allege that the plaintiff was more negligent than she was and is therefore barred from recovery. She might deny that she had a contract with the plaintiff, raise as a second defense that she did not breach, and raise as a third defense that the statute of limitations bars recovery. Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn\u2019t required to stake her case on one of them. Although Rule 11(b)(3) requires support for affirmative defenses as well as factual allegations in the original complaint, it is unfortunately common for defendants to \u2018\u2018overplead\u2019\u2019 affirmative defenses. Given the short period for filing an answer, and the potential for malpractice exposure for failing to raise a defense, many answers include a long list of \u2018\u2018boilerplate\u2019\u2019 defenses, many clearly irrelevant to the case. Doubtless, counsel view the risk of sanctions for overpleading defenses as less grievous than the risk of waiving a defense by failing to assert it. The unfortunate side effect of this, however, is that such answers do not fully serve the purpose the rule-makers envisioned: to reveal the parties\u2019 real positions and to narrow the scope of controverted issues. Here\u2019s a question that explores the defendant\u2019s options.", "This is a nice question. Clearly, AE doesn\u2019t want to admit that Adair acted in the scope of employment, but it does have some evidence tending to support that position. What should it do? C is \u2018\u2018wrongest.\u2019\u2019 Rule 8(b)(5) provides that, where a party pleads that it doesn\u2019t have enough information to admit or deny, that response \u2018\u2018has the effect of a denial.\u2019\u2019 (If this \u2018\u2018I dunno\u2019\u2019 response were treated as an admission, parties would rarely use it.) Basically, this response keeps the defendant\u2019s options open to develop evidence that Adair was not in the scope of employment, without having to explicitly take that position in the answer before it has fully developed its case. Because the Rules treat this response as a denial, C is wrong. AE has not admitted the allegation, and may still try to disprove the scope-of-employment allegation. B also falls short. Rule 8 requires the pleader to admit or deny the allegations, or state that she is without sufficient information. Further, Rule 8(b)(6) provides that allegations that are not denied in the answer are admitted. So ignoring the allegation would be ill advised. A is an interesting suggestion. The rules expressly allow the parties to take different positions\u2014where they don\u2019t know the true facts\u2014 \u2018\u2018regardless of consistency.\u2019\u2019 So, if you have some evidence suggesting that the allegation is true, and some suggesting that it is false, why not admit and deny? It\u2019s hard to plead more honestly than that! Of course, the defendant presumably does not want to admit that Adair acted in the scope of employment. So the fact that it would be permissible to take inconsistent positions isn\u2019t the end of the matter . . . must the defendant do so? Certainly not. A pleader decides what defenses she wishes to raise, from those permissible under the rules. Because AE has evidentiary support for the position that Adair did not act in the scope of his employment, a denial is proper. AE has grounds to admit it too, since they have some evidence of that as well, but clearly doesn\u2019t want to raise that as a \u2018\u2018defense\u2019\u2019 and isn\u2019t required to. D is the best answer. If you work in a defense firm, I wouldn\u2019t suggest that you recommend admitting a damaging allegation, simply because you have some information suggesting that it is true. Ordinarily, an admission removes the issue from contention (though perhaps not if admitted and denied!), and this one is still very much an open question. Where the defendant has grounds to deny a damaging allegation such as this, it may do so under the rules, and certainly will. An alternative would be to respond that AE is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the averment in Paragraph 4. This is permissible if you really don\u2019t know, and leaves the issue open, since this response \u2018\u2018has the effect of a denial.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(5). However, given its obligation under Rule 11 to conduct a reasonable investigation before answering, it seems likely that AE would know enough about Adair\u2019s meanderings to take a position on the scope of employment issue. Even if it could reply that it was \u2018\u2018without sufficient knowledge,\u2019\u2019 C would still be wrong, since it states that this response is treated as an admission. Here\u2019s another interesting question on denials under Rule 8(b).2", "This is a nice question. Clearly, AE doesn\u2019t want to admit that Adair acted in the scope of employment, but it does have some evidence tending to support that position. What should it do?

So the fact that it would be permissible to take inconsistent positions isn\u2019t the end of the matter . . . must the defendant do so? Certainly not. A pleader decides what defenses she wishes to raise, from those permissible under the rules. Because AE has evidentiary support for the position that Adair did not act in the scope of his employment, a denial is proper. AE has grounds to admit it too, since they have some evidence of that as well, but clearly doesn\u2019t want to raise that as a \u2018\u2018defense\u2019\u2019 and isn\u2019t required to. D is the best answer. If you work in a defense firm, I wouldn\u2019t suggest that you recommend admitting a damaging allegation, simply because you have some information suggesting that it is true. Ordinarily, an admission removes the issue from contention (though perhaps not if admitted and denied!), and this one is still very much an open question. Where the defendant has grounds to deny a damaging allegation such as this, it may do so under the rules, and certainly will. An alternative would be to respond that AE is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the averment in Paragraph 4. This is permissible if you really don\u2019t know, and leaves the issue open, since this response \u2018\u2018has the effect of a denial.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(5). However, given its obligation under Rule 11 to conduct a reasonable investigation before answering, it seems likely that AE would know enough about Adair\u2019s meanderings to take a position on the scope of employment issue. Even if it could reply that it was \u2018\u2018without sufficient knowledge,\u2019\u2019 C would still be wrong, since it states that this response is treated as an admission. Here\u2019s another interesting question on denials under Rule 8(b).2", "This is a nice question. Clearly, AE doesn\u2019t want to admit that Adair acted in the scope of employment, but it does have some evidence tending to support that position. What should it do? C is \u2018\u2018wrongest.\u2019\u2019 Rule 8(b)(5) provides that, where a party pleads that it doesn\u2019t have enough information to admit or deny, that response \u2018\u2018has the effect of a denial.\u2019\u2019 (If this \u2018\u2018I dunno\u2019\u2019 response were treated as an admission, parties would rarely use it.) Basically, this response keeps the defendant\u2019s options open to develop evidence that Adair was not in the scope of employment, without having to explicitly take that position in the answer before it has fully developed its case. Because the Rules treat this response as a denial, C is wrong. AE has not admitted the allegation, and may still try to disprove the scope-of-employment allegation. B also falls short. Rule 8 requires the pleader to admit or deny the allegations, or state that she is without sufficient information. Further, Rule 8(b)(6) provides that allegations that are not denied in the answer are admitted. So ignoring the allegation would be ill advised. A is an interesting suggestion. The rules expressly allow the parties to take different positions\u2014where they don\u2019t know the true facts\u2014 \u2018\u2018regardless of consistency.\u2019\u2019 So, if you have some evidence suggesting that the allegation is true, and some suggesting that it is false, why not admit and deny?

D takes the position that the amended complaint will relate back, since it arises from the same arrest. This is wrong, because Rule 15(c)(1) (C) provides that the amendment will only relate back if that is true and the two further requirements in Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i) and 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) are met. C suggests that the amendment to add White will relate back, because White knew, within the limitations period for Williams\u2019s claim, that Black had been sued.

Surely this is appropriate. Frivolous papers are an affront to the court and a waste of its time as well as that of the parties. The court has the power to sanction them whether a party has requested it to do so or not. B suggests an important point. The fact that a party\u2019s position on the merits is rejected by a court does not mean that a filing taking that position is automatically frivolous. Remember that the rule expressly allows litigants to argue for change or extension of existing law. Such arguments for change will be accepted in some cases but rejected in many. To subject all losing substantive arguments to sanctions would be inconsistent with the fundamental premise of Rule 11 and our common law system. C should fail, and does. There\u2019s a difference between challenging the position taken in a pleading on its merits and challenging it as sanctionable conduct. Here, Rendoso did the former but not the latter. He did not ask for sanctions when the complaint was filed or before he moved to dismiss it. When he wins on the merits he decides to seek sanctions for what went before. The court is likely to hold, as most courts apparently do, that Rendoso\u2019s failure to use the \u2018\u2018safe harbor\u2019\u2019 provision to challenge the claim precludes him from seeking sanctions later on. See Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71337.2. If Withers had sent a motion under Rule 11(c)(2), Rendoso might have seen the error of his ways and withdrawn the claim, saving time and expense for everyone. Withers cannot circumvent this procedure by waiting until the court expends time addressing the questionable claim and then filing a motion for sanctions directly with the court. Choose A.", "Let\u2019s work through them in order. A is not authorized by Rule 11: His Honor has sanctioned the client for a legal position asserted by her counsel. Rule 11(c)(5)(A) bars this. The logic for this is not far to seek. It is the lawyers who determine what legal positions to assert in a pleading; the clients know little or nothing about it and rely on counsel to do this. Consequently, it is the lawyers who take the risk of sanctions for asserting frivolous legal claims. B is a proper order. Rule 11(c)(1) provides that, \u2018\u2018absent exceptional circumstances,\u2019\u2019 a law firm is jointly liable with the offending pleader for Rule 11 sanctions. Hopefully, this provision creates an incentive for other members of the firm to oversee its litigators\u2019 filings, and an incentive for the filing lawyer not to go over the line and put her partners on the hook, too. C is a proper sanctions order, though doubtless embarrassing to Norris. Rule 11(c)(4) allows a judge to impose \u2018\u2018nonmonetary sanctions\u2019\u2019 like this, and it has indeed been done. Not good for a litigator\u2019s reputation. Judge Fudd\u2019s order in D is improper. Sanctions for violations of the discovery rules are separately covered by Rule 26(g)(3) and Rule 37.

A defendant does not waive objections to personal jurisdiction by removing a case to federal court. When sued in a state court, the defendant has only thirty days to remove. He can\u2019t wait for the state court to rule on an objection to personal jurisdiction, and then remove if he loses on it. He has to remove right away, before the issue is likely to be decided by the state court. Suppose the defendant reasons as follows: \u2018\u2018I think the Utah court lacks personal jurisdiction over me for this claim. I\u2019d like to get the case dismissed on that ground. But if the court doesn\u2019t agree that it lacks jurisdiction, I\u2019d rather litigate this case in federal court.\u2019\u2019 If this is the defendant\u2019s thinking, he has to remove, doesn\u2019t he, since the state court is unlikely to rule on the personal jurisdiction question in the first thirty days? It would be a tough rule that tells this defendant: \u2018\u2018remove if you like, but if you do you are consenting to suit in this state.\u2019\u2019 The rules don\u2019t put a defendant to this choice, because he does not waive his objection to personal jurisdiction in Utah by removing; he simply changes the court in which the question will be decided. After removal, the Utah federal court, instead of the state court, will decide whether the defendant is subject to jurisdiction in Utah. So A is wrong. C is another loser.

And that\u2019s what Hue did here. He appeared, in a state that uses the special appearance approach to jurisdictional objections, and raised a defense of failure to state a claim along with his objection to personal jurisdiction. Big mistake! In states that adhere to the traditional special appearance approach, this constitutes a general appearance and waives the objection to jurisdiction. So B is probably right. Hue waived the objection before removing. Since the objection was waived before removal, it can\u2019t be revived by removal. It makes no difference that he could have raised both defenses together in federal court (D). He certainly could have done that, if he had responded in federal court under Rule 12. But he didn\u2019t respond in federal court; he responded in state court, and state procedure applies until the case is removed. A caveat is in order here. I\u2019ve had some battles with a colleague over this one. He argues that the objection is not waived, since no decision was made in state court before removal that Hue had waived his objection.

He has to remove right away, before the issue is likely to be decided by the state court. Suppose the defendant reasons as follows: \u2018\u2018I think the Utah court lacks personal jurisdiction over me for this claim. I\u2019d like to get the case dismissed on that ground. But if the court doesn\u2019t agree that it lacks jurisdiction, I\u2019d rather litigate this case in federal court.\u2019\u2019 If this is the defendant\u2019s thinking, he has to remove, doesn\u2019t he, since the state court is unlikely to rule on the personal jurisdiction question in the first thirty days? It would be a tough rule that tells this defendant: \u2018\u2018remove if you like, but if you do you are consenting to suit in this state.\u2019\u2019 The rules don\u2019t put a defendant to this choice, because he does not waive his objection to personal jurisdiction in Utah by removing; he simply changes the court in which the question will be decided. After removal, the Utah federal court, instead of the state court, will decide whether the defendant is subject to jurisdiction in Utah. So A is wrong. C is another loser. It suggests that the objection is still valid because under federal procedure it can be asserted in the answer. But state procedure applies until removal, and under this state\u2019s procedure (the example indicates) you waive your objection by appearing in the action and failing to confine your objection to the lack of personal jurisdiction. And that\u2019s what Hue did here. He appeared, in a state that uses the special appearance approach to jurisdictional objections, and raised a defense of failure to state a claim along with his objection to personal jurisdiction. Big mistake! In states that adhere to the traditional special appearance approach, this constitutes a general appearance and waives the objection to jurisdiction. So B is probably right. Hue waived the objection before removing. Since the objection was waived before removal, it can\u2019t be revived by removal. It makes no difference that he could have raised both defenses together in federal court (D). He certainly could have done that, if he had responded in federal court under Rule 12. But he didn\u2019t respond in federal court; he responded in state court, and state procedure applies until the case is removed. A caveat is in order here. I\u2019ve had some battles with a colleague over this one. He argues that the objection is not waived, since no decision was made in state court before removal that Hue had waived his objection.

Let\u2019s consider the witness list first. Mason\u2019s counsel cannot protect the names of witnesses he is aware of simply because he learned of them in the course of trial preparation. But why not? Isn\u2019t this \u2018\u2018work product,\u2019\u2019 in the sense that he unearthed the names of these witnesses through his trial preparation efforts? Well, in a sense this is \u2018\u2018trial preparation material\u2019\u2019; it is information Mason\u2019s counsel has learned in the course of preparing the case. However, the protection does not apply to everything an attorney knows or learns. It applies, under Rule 26(b)(3) to \u2018\u2018documents and tangible things\u2019\u2019 created during trial preparation, and attorneys\u2019 strategic musings, but not to the facts those documents contain. Even though Mason\u2019s counsel discovered these facts himself while developing his case, this will not shield the information from discovery. Mason\u2019s lawyer is his agent, and his knowledge of facts about the case will be attributed to Mason. Thus, when Mason answers the interrogatory (and it is the client, not the lawyer, who signs the answers), he will have to include responsive information developed by his lawyer about the case. So A is wrong; Mason must answer the interrogatory requesting the names of relevant witnesses. The other choices consider whether Rule 26(b)(3) protects the witness statement from discovery. D takes the view that it must be produced under Rule 26(b)(3)(C), which deals specifically with witness statements. This is too loose a reading of the subsection, however. This provision allows a party to obtain her own statement about the case. It also allows a nonparty to obtain her own statement. It does not apply where a party seeks a statement of a nonparty. So is it B or C? Since Collins\u2019s statement was taken during the course of trial preparation by Mason\u2019s counsel, it enjoys protection under the work product doctrine, unless that presumptive protection is overcome under Rule 26(b)(3). The presumption is not likely to be overcome here. Drake will not likely be able to show that he could not obtain substantially equivalent information in another way. Collins lives in Boston. Although he refused an informal interview, he presumably can be subpoenaed for a deposition to obtain his testimony. Thus, the presumptive protection of the Rule is not overcome.

If the information sought is protected, it will have to be under the work product doctrine, not attorney-client privilege. But Rule 26(b)(3), by its terms, does not provide such protection. It extends work product protection to \u2018\u2018documents and tangible things.\u2019\u2019 The questions here seek oral testimony concerning Sanders\u2019s conversations with Marathon\u2019s counsel, so the rule does not apply. B is wrong. Although Rule 26(b)(3) doesn\u2019t apply, E, which takes the position that the objection should be overruled, is not the best answer either. The case law has held that Rule 26(b)(3) has partially codified the work product protection recognized in Hickman. It governs where the material sought to be protected is found in documents or tangible things. But, where similar work product information not included in a document or tangible thing is sought, the cases look back to Hickman and extend similar protection to the material. In other words, Rule 26(b)(3) is not the exclusive source of work product protection. Attorneys\u2019 mental processes can still be protected under the common law protection stemming from Hickman as well. So, we\u2019re down to C and D. C asserts that the material is protected, but that the protection can be overcome if DeMarco makes a showing similar to that required under Rule 26(b)(3): that he really needs it and can\u2019t get equivalent information any other way. This is close, but likely wrong as well. Here, the material sought is true \u2018\u2018opinion work product,\u2019\u2019 that is, it seeks the mental impressions of counsel about what the major problems are with the case. This type of evaluative judgment by counsel enjoys almost complete protection under Hickman and Rule 26(b)(3). See Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 510-514 (1947) (noting damage to the legal profession from requiring production of counsel\u2019s mental impressions); compare Rule 26(b)(3)(B) (even if requesting party makes the required showing, \u2018\u2018the court must protect against disclosure of the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions or theories of a party\u2019s attorney or other representative\u2019\u2019).

D is wrong, because Maurice does meet the amount requirement against O\u2019Connell.

The courts have generally taken the position that Maurice must seek more than $75,000 against Parker to meet the amount requirement.2 He can\u2019t bootstrap a claim against Parker for less than the required amount onto his claim against O\u2019Connell for more. And B is wrong, because the aggregation rules don\u2019t allow aggregation of amounts sought against different defendants. A is correct. Maurice meets the amount requirement against O\u2019Connell, by adding his two unrelated claims against him. But he cannot add Parker as a codefendant, since he seeks less than $75,000.01 in damages from him. Frequently, a plaintiff sues two or more defendants on a tort claim for injuries arguably worth more than $75,000. Suppose, for example, that Epstein suffers nerve damage during surgery, and that the damages are $90,000. He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith\u2019s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe\u2019s fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe \u2018\u2018jointly and severally liable\u2019\u2019 for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence.

D also falls short, because the work product privilege would apply to a document produced by an agent of Black Corporation, a party to the case, to assist the party in planning litigation strategy.

Although inadvertent disclosure tends to occur most frequently in exchange of electronic discovery, Rule 26(b)(5)(B) does not apply solely to electronic documents. It speaks of the production of \u2018\u2018information,\u2019\u2019 and Pasco\u2019s memo certainly satisfies that standard, even if it\u2019s an old fashioned hard copy. So C fails as well. That brings us to the crux of the matter: What exactly does Rule 26(b)(5)(B) require White\u2019s lawyers to do when informed of an inadvertent disclosure? B is wrong: It does not require them to return the document, although that is one of the options under the rule. Alternatively, it may \u2018\u2018sequester\u2019\u2019 the document, lock it away until a court decides whether Black has waived work product protection by mistakenly producing it.

Here, NorthStar has noticed the deposition of Roh, a former supervisor who is likely to be \u2018\u2018their\u2019\u2019 witness, in the sense that he is likely to testify favorably to them. (If he were likely to testify unfavorably to NorthStar, they would presumably allow him to disappear undeposed.) Clearly, they have decided to take his deposition because he may not be available for trial. If he is unavailable, they plan to use his deposition testimony at trial instead, as Rule 32(a)(4)(B) allows. The fact that Roh\u2019s deposition is likely to be used at trial changes the equation. At such a \u2018\u2018trial deposition,\u2019\u2019 NorthStar will be conducting direct examination of Roh, their own witness, as they would at trial, and Czonka\u2019s counsel had better be prepared to cross-examine Roh just as though she were doing so at trial. However, since the deposition is being conducted so early, Czonka\u2019s counsel is not fully ready to do so. Let\u2019s dispose quickly of D.

As the introduction states, the lawyer who did not notice the deposition (said to be \u2018\u2018defending the deposition\u2019\u2019) usually does not cross-examine extensively at a deposition, if she can discuss the case privately with the witness. But C is wrong here, because the deposition is being taken to perpetuate the witness\u2019s testimony for trial, not to obtain information. If Roh does not appear at trial, cross-examining at the deposition will be the only opportunity Czonka\u2019s counsel has to cross- examine Roh under oath. She had better do it as well as she can. On this logic, A is the best answer. Czonka\u2019s counsel could move for a protective order postponing the deposition till later in discovery, as B suggests. But she isn\u2019t likely to succeed if Roh is about to leave the country. Once he\u2019s gone, he\u2019s gone. He no longer works for NorthStar, so it could not make him return for trial.

As the introduction states, the lawyer who did not notice the deposition (said to be \u2018\u2018defending the deposition\u2019\u2019) usually does not cross-examine extensively at a deposition, if she can discuss the case privately with the witness. But C is wrong here, because the deposition is being taken to perpetuate the witness\u2019s testimony for trial, not to obtain information. If Roh does not appear at trial, cross-examining at the deposition will be the only opportunity Czonka\u2019s counsel has to cross- examine Roh under oath. She had better do it as well as she can. On this logic, A is the best answer. Czonka\u2019s counsel could move for a protective order postponing the deposition till later in discovery, as B suggests. But she isn\u2019t likely to succeed if Roh is about to leave the country. Once he\u2019s gone, he\u2019s gone. He no longer works for NorthStar, so it could not make him return for trial. Consequently, the judge is not likely to prevent the taking of his deposition, even though it leaves Czonka at a disadvantage.", "The usual purpose of the deposition is to gather information, or to pin down the opposing party\u2019s witnesses on the record. But that isn\u2019t the purpose of this deposition. Here, NorthStar has noticed the deposition of Roh, a former supervisor who is likely to be \u2018\u2018their\u2019\u2019 witness, in the sense that he is likely to testify favorably to them. (If he were likely to testify unfavorably to NorthStar, they would presumably allow him to disappear undeposed.) Clearly, they have decided to take his deposition because he may not be available for trial. If he is unavailable, they plan to use his deposition testimony at trial instead, as Rule 32(a)(4)(B) allows. The fact that Roh\u2019s deposition is likely to be used at trial changes the equation. At such a \u2018\u2018trial deposition,\u2019\u2019 NorthStar will be conducting direct examination of Roh, their own witness, as they would at trial, and Czonka\u2019s counsel had better be prepared to cross-examine Roh just as though she were doing so at trial.

It suggests that the judge, by denying the earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law, has determined that Uberoth\u2019s evidence is sufficient, so this issue is settled. The fact that the judge denies a motion for a directed verdict does not always mean that she has concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s case is adequately supported by the evidence. It may simply mean that she is reserving judgment, perhaps hoping that the jury will settle the issue by finding for the defendant. The very point of Rule 50(b) is that the denial of a prior motion under Rule 50(a) does not inevitably mean that the judge considers the evidence sufficient. It may simply reflect her desire to \u2018\u2018save the trial\u2019\u2019 by ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence after the verdict rather than before. The right answer here flows from the rationale for the Rule 50(b) requirement that the motion for judgment be made before the case goes to the jury, in order to preserve the right to seek judgment notwithstanding the verdict after a verdict. Here, Colon moved for a directed verdict before the case went to the jury, on the ground that the evidence did not show that he knew that the statements he made about the investment were false. This motion put Uberoth on notice of a possible weakness in his proof of this element of his case. If he had further evidence about Colon\u2019s knowledge that the statements were false, he could ask the court to allow him to reopen his case, and submit that proof. But the motion on this ground did not put Uberoth on notice that his proof of reliance, a separate element, was inadequate. When Colon moves for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on this ground, the challenge comes out of the blue, at a time when Uberoth can no longer do anything about it. In the language of poker, Colon has \u2018\u2018sandbagged\u2019\u2019 Uberoth by keeping this objection in his back pocket, letting the case go to the jury and raising the reliance issue after the jury\u2019s verdict, when it is too late to offer any further evidence of reliance. Of course, it\u2019s true that it\u2019s Uberoth\u2019s case to prove. He should know the elements of a claim for fraud, and assumes the responsibility of proving them at trial. If he hasn\u2019t proven one of them, perhaps he should take the consequences. But the point of the Rule 50(b) requirement of a prior Rule 50(a) motion is to put him on notice of the defect before the case goes to the jury, and Colon didn\u2019t put him on notice of the defect in proof of reliance at that point. It is not enough that he moved for judgment as a matter of law on some ground to preserve his right to judgment as a matter of law after the verdict. His motion must raise the objection he renews in the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. So B is the right answer here; the motion will be denied based on Colon\u2019s failure to raise this challenge to Uberoth\u2019s proof before the case went to the jury. Although D seems like it should be right, Colon will have forfeited his right to judgment on this ground by failing to raise it before the case goes to the jury. This is one more illustration of a basic point: procedure matters. A is a little tricky. Rule 50(b) provides that the motion may be made \u2018\u2018within twenty-eight days of the entry of judgment.\u2019\u2019 But there\u2019s no reason it can\u2019t be made before entry of judgment.

She has concluded that the evidence is too weak to support a verdict for Parkins. Consequently, Orwell is the winner. Judgment should enter for him. But Rule 50(c)(1) tells the trial judge not to leave it at that, to rule \u2018\u2018conditionally\u2019\u2019 on the motion for a new trial too. When the judge does that, she is saying, \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve taken the verdict away from Parkins and ordered judgment entered for Orwell, because the evidence is too weak to support a rational verdict for Parkins. So I\u2019m granting judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) for Orwell. Rule 50(c)(1) tells me I have to rule on the new trial motion too, so I\u2019m stating that, if the appellate court reverses my Rule 50(b) ruling, I would grant a new trial in this case, because the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence.\u2019\u2019 Fine, but where does the case go from there? C is wrong, because Rule 50(c)(2) provides that a conditional grant of a new trial \u2018\u2018does not affect the judgment\u2019s finality.\u2019\u2019 The judge has ordered final judgment entered for the defendant, and that will happen. The case is over in the trial court. If no appeal is taken, the judgment for Orwell will stand as the final adjudication of the case. True, the judge has said that, if her order is overturned, there should be a new trial, but only if the order is overturned on appeal. So there is a final judgment, and the case is therefore appealable. But which order is appealable, the order for judgment as a matter of law, or the new trial order, or both? D is wrong, because both orders are appealable. That\u2019s the reason for having the trial judge make both rulings, so that the appellate court can review both and properly dispose of the case. Even though the ruling on the new trial is \u2018\u2018conditional,\u2019\u2019 that is, it will only take effect if the grant of judgment as a matter of law is reversed, that ruling is still reviewable. If the appellate court reverses the entry of judgment for Orwell under Rule 50(b), it can then decide whether the motion for new trial was appropriately granted. Thus, B fails as well. Both orders are appealable. If the appellate court concludes (after reversing the judgment for Orwell) that the new trial was properly granted, it will remand for the new trial. If the court concludes that this motion also should not have been granted, it will reverse the new trial order too, and order entry of judgment for Parkins on the jury\u2019s verdict. A takes the cake. Just to nail this complex concept down, here\u2019s another Closer. This one also considers what the appellate court should do if it disagrees with the trial judge\u2019s rulings, or some of them.", "The crux of the matter here is that the judge has granted the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law.

The court in which the second action is filed will apply the preclusion law of the court that decided the first.

In his original action, Pelham sued in federal court, and left out the state law claims for assault and battery.

Here, he could not have brought a second federal court action. The federal courts follow the Second Restatement\u2019s transactional approach to preclusion. Under that approach, the assault and battery claims will be barred if they arise from the same events as the federal civil rights claim and could have been brought in the first suit. B suggests that a second action should be allowed because these state law claims could not have been asserted in the federal suit.

The suggestion in A, that we can\u2019t tell what was decided in the first case, fails. The City raised three defenses. Any one of these defenses, if accepted, would lead to a defendant\u2019s verdict. Since Perez won, the jury must have rejected all three defenses. They must have found that the mayor believed that Perez had supported Appolonia, that he was demoted for it, and that he had not waived his claim to damages. So we know what they decided on each of these issues. Which of these findings was necessary to the judgment? They all were. The jury had to reject all three defenses in order to render a verdict for Perez. They couldn\u2019t find for Perez without rejecting all three defenses. If, for example, they had found that the mayor had not believed that Perez had supported Appolonia, they would not have awarded damages for violation of his First Amendment rights in demoting him for it. Consequently, their finding on this issue was necessary to the outcome in the first suit. And the same is true of the other two defenses. Thus, C is wrong, because, if the jury had reached a different result on any one of these three defenses, the City would have won. But it didn\u2019t, so the jury must have rejected them all, and rejecting all three led to the verdict they returned.

But they can, so long as the plaintiff relies on some basis of federal jurisdiction other than diversity. If Smith sues Doe, another Nevadan, for a federal civil rights violation under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, he may of course do so in federal court, even though both parties are from the same state. C is also wrong, because, even though there is no independent basis for jurisdiction over Isaacs\u2019s state law claims, there will be supplemental jurisdiction over at least one. The supplemental jurisdiction statute authorizes federal courts that have jurisdiction over a case, because a proper federal claim is asserted, to hear the entire \u2018\u2018case,\u2019\u2019 that is, the parties\u2019 entire dispute arising out of the same underlying facts. That includes claims arising from those events that don\u2019t independently qualify for federal court jurisdiction. Here, Isaacs\u2019s breach of contract claim arises from his discharge, as his federal ADEA claim does. Since the ADEA claim arises under federal law, it provides a basis for federal court jurisdiction, and supplemental jurisdiction sweeps in other claims arising from the same facts. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a) (allowing supplemental claims that arise out of the \u2018\u2018same case or controversy\u2019\u2019 as the federally sufficient claim). The closer choice here is between A and D. The crucial question is whether the misappropriation claim arises from the same \u2018\u2018nucleus of operative facts\u2019\u2019 as the discharge claims. I would think not. This claim arises from United\u2019s use of his design. He would have this claim whether he had been discharged or not, and the claim accrued well before the discharge. The answer might be different, or at least closer, if the question suggested that Isaacs was fired for making a claim to the design, but it doesn\u2019t. So D is the best answer. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim, because it arises from the same underlying dispute as the ADEA claim. But the misappropriation claim arises from other, only tangentially related events, and would not qualify under \u00a71367 (or under U.M.W. v. Gibbs) for supplemental jurisdiction.", "C seems like a pretty reasonable answer here. Why should Taney, who invoked the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction, be allowed to challenge it when the case looks as though it may be going sour? Isn\u2019t he manipulating the system, and shouldn\u2019t he be estopped from denying jurisdiction, in order to discourage such manipulation? There\u2019s a fair argument for that view, but other considerations outweigh the risk of manipulation. Federal subject matter jurisdiction involves more than the interests of the parties. It implicates the constitutional balance between the federal and state governments. In order to assure that federal courts don\u2019t exceed their constitutional authority, they will always entertain a challenge to their subject matter jurisdiction. After all, if the federal court exercises jurisdiction over a case it lacks the power to hear, the resulting judgment will be subject to reversal on appeal, since a judgment rendered without the power to enter it is invalid. To avoid such wasteful and unconstitutional exercises, the trial court will always consider challenges to its jurisdiction. \u2018\u2018If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\u2019\u2019 Fed.

The objection of lack of subject matter jurisdiction is never waived\u2014at least, it remains subject to direct attack on appeal, even if no objection was raised in the trial court. In Mottley, for example, the issue was raised by the Supreme Court itself. Federal Rule 12(h)(3) confirms that this is true throughout the litigation in the trial court, even if it is the plaintiff who raises the problem. Consider what would happen if the rule were otherwise: Suppose that the parties wanted to litigate a case in federal court that did not satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiff could file suit in federal court, and the defendant could simply fail to object. If such a failure to raise jurisdictional defects authorized the federal court to hear the case, the parties could evade the constitutional limits on federal judicial power. Of course, the federal judge might note the lack of jurisdiction on her own motion, and dismiss, but the limits on federal judicial power should not be left to discretion or to chance.3 So Taney has not waived the right to make the motion by failing to raise the jurisdiction issue earlier.

I suppose the logic here is that, as long as it would not offend constitutional limits for the federal court to hear the case, it has the power to do so, even if the case does not satisfy Congress\u2019s statutory limits on arising-under jurisdiction. However, a federal court exceeds its authority when it exercises jurisdiction that Congress has not granted, just as it would if it exercised jurisdiction not within the constitutional grant. So, the court will dismiss a case that is not authorized by statute, as well as one that goes beyond the Article III constitutional grant. So B, then, is the best answer.

There\u2019s a fair argument for that view, but other considerations outweigh the risk of manipulation. Federal subject matter jurisdiction involves more than the interests of the parties. It implicates the constitutional balance between the federal and state governments. In order to assure that federal courts don\u2019t exceed their constitutional authority, they will always entertain a challenge to their subject matter jurisdiction. After all, if the federal court exercises jurisdiction over a case it lacks the power to hear, the resulting judgment will be subject to reversal on appeal, since a judgment rendered without the power to enter it is invalid. To avoid such wasteful and unconstitutional exercises, the trial court will always consider challenges to its jurisdiction. \u2018\u2018If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). This reasoning disposes of D as well. The objection of lack of subject matter jurisdiction is never waived\u2014at least, it remains subject to direct attack on appeal, even if no objection was raised in the trial court. In Mottley, for example, the issue was raised by the Supreme Court itself. Federal Rule 12(h)(3) confirms that this is true throughout the litigation in the trial court, even if it is the plaintiff who raises the problem. Consider what would happen if the rule were otherwise: Suppose that the parties wanted to litigate a case in federal court that did not satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiff could file suit in federal court, and the defendant could simply fail to object. If such a failure to raise jurisdictional defects authorized the federal court to hear the case, the parties could evade the constitutional limits on federal judicial power. Of course, the federal judge might note the lack of jurisdiction on her own motion, and dismiss, but the limits on federal judicial power should not be left to discretion or to chance.3 So Taney has not waived the right to make the motion by failing to raise the jurisdiction issue earlier. A suggests that the court can retain the case if it \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law as that phrase is used in Article III, \u00a72, even if \u00a71331 doesn\u2019t authorize federal jurisdiction over it. I suppose the logic here is that, as long as it would not offend constitutional limits for the federal court to hear the case, it has the power to do so, even if the case does not satisfy Congress\u2019s statutory limits on arising-under jurisdiction. However, a federal court exceeds its authority when it exercises jurisdiction that Congress has not granted, just as it would if it exercised jurisdiction not within the constitutional grant. So, the court will dismiss a case that is not authorized by statute, as well as one that goes beyond the Article III constitutional grant. So B, then, is the best answer. To avoid exceeding the limits on its jurisdictional competence, the federal court will dismiss if it determines that it lacks jurisdiction, despite Taney\u2019s failure to raise the objection earlier.", "C seems like a pretty reasonable answer here.

Glannon thinks he does know the best answer here (as always!) and your professor will think she does as well. A might be right, but it probably reads Justice Breyer\u2019s concurring opinion in J. McIntyre too narrowly. That opinion rejected jurisdiction on the facts of the case but suggested that in other circumstances a regular flow of goods into the state would support jurisdiction. Here, a significant number of Atlanta Precision presses are sold in Maryland each year, which would likely influence Justice Breyer to find jurisdiction proper. At the least, we can\u2019t say that he (and Justice Alito, the other concurring Justice) would \u2018\u2018definitely\u2019\u2019 find no jurisdiction where the manufacturer\u2019s goods are being resold in significant quantities in the state on a regular basis. B provides a nice turn of phrase, but it pushes the concept of the product as \u2018\u2018agent for service of process\u2019\u2019 too far. The question is whether the manufacturer somehow has affiliated itself with the forum state in a way that makes jurisdiction fair. It seems likely that at least the three J. McIntyre dissenters and the two concurring Justices would find that this can be true based on resale of goods into the state by a distributor, if it sells a significant amount of the defendant\u2019s goods into the state over a period of time. And C is a pretty dippy distractor; the question is not how many states Emporia resells the presses to, but whether Atlanta Precision has established a deliberate affiliation with Maryland, either through direct efforts to sell in Maryland or, perhaps, through substantial resales of its products there. So D seems the best choice, though it is certainly less than certain that the Court will find jurisdiction on these facts if it gets this case . . . in another twenty-four years!1 So the three cases represent two ends of the spectrum and a point in between. The first case is much like J. McIntyre, in which a majority of the Justices rejected jurisdiction. The second illustrates (I think) a case that is likely to satisfy the purposeful availment requirement in a stream- of-commerce case, because the defendant has deliberately sought to promote sales of its product in the state. And the third is a case that is a \u2018\u2018pure\u2019\u2019 stream-of-commerce case, but one in which a majority of the Court might be willing to find jurisdiction proper based on significant ongoing sales in the forum state.

Generally, under that rule, the court may exercise jurisdiction if the courts of the state in which the federal court sits could do so. As was pointed out in the removal chapter (see pp. 64-66), removing a case to federal court does not waive the right to object to personal jurisdiction. It simply changes the court in which the objection will be raised. Jason may remove and then move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The Arizona federal court will then determine whether it has statutory and constitutional authority to exercise jurisdiction over him. So E here is a nonstarter. Choice C is tempting but incorrect. Under Federal Rule 4(k)(1)(A) the court indeed will ask whether it would be constitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment to exercise jurisdiction over Jason. But it will also ask whether Arizona\u2019s long-arm statute has authorized its courts to exercise jurisdiction in the circumstances of Argo\u2019s case. So this choice is incomplete. D is a nonstarter as well. It takes the broad position that, because the federal court could constitutionally exercise jurisdiction based on minimum contacts anywhere in the United States, the court has jurisdiction here. But, not to beat a dead myrmidon,9 the fact that the federal court has constitutional power to exercise personal jurisdiction over Jason is only one step of the analysis. Jurisdiction must also be authorized by statute (or, in this case, by a Rule promulgated pursuant to statutory authority).

Many cases have been dismissed for lack of proper service, even though the defendant knew that she had been sued or even received a copy of the complaint. See Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a74.03[3][a]. Service is a formal act by which a court asserts its authority over the defendant.

Stamski delivered the papers personally to Donitz, which is a proper means of serving an individual defendant under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2)(A). Delivering the summons and complaint for Preferred to Donitz personally also constitutes proper service on the corporation under Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h) (1)(B), because he is an officer of the corporation. But nothing indicates that Preferred is subject to personal jurisdiction in Indiana for this claim \u2014there are no facts suggesting that it has any presence in Indiana. Its president lives there, but this contact will not be attributed to the corporation, and the events giving rise to the claim took place in Ohio. In D, Stamski served process on Preferred using a method authorized by Ohio law for service on a corporation, but one that was not authorized by Kentucky service rules, the state where the action is pending. But that\u2019s alright; Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(1) authorizes service under the state rules for the state in which the action is pending or those of the state where service is made. So, service is proper on the corporation, and it is almost certainly subject to general in personam jurisdiction in the state of its principal place of business, even though the claim arose out of acts in another state. So he\u2019s nailed Preferred. And service is proper on Donitz, since the summons and complaint were delivered to him personally. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(2). However, there is nothing to suggest that Donitz is subject to personal jurisdiction in Kentucky for this claim, which arises out of events in Ohio. Since he is domiciled in Indiana, it is highly unlikely that he is subject to general in personam jurisdiction in Kentucky; the fact that Preferred is does not mean that its president is. B suggests that, since the officers of Preferred are not in Ohio, service by publication is proper. No way! First, there is no provision in Federal Rule 4 that authorizes service by publication. However, state service of process rules often provide that, if the defendant cannot be served through the usual methods, the court may authorize service in another way such as publication. See, e.g., Alaska Rules of Civil Procedure 4(e). So, in an appropriate case, a plaintiff may obtain a court order for service by publication, by looking to such a state service provision. See Rule 4(h)(1)(A) (incorporating state service rules for corporations). But this is not an appropriate case, since, while Donitz and other officers of Preferred are not physically present in Ohio, Stamski knows where they are and can use other methods of service much more likely to inform them of the action, such as mail or personal delivery in some other state. Publication is a last resort, and there are several more effective options here. In A, service is proper on Preferred, because the summons commanding Preferred to respond was delivered to Donitz, an officer of Preferred, together with a copy of the complaint. But no summons addressed to Donitz was served on him. Even though Donitz received a summons, as well as a copy of the complaint, service here is technically deficient. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(a)(1)(B) (summons must be \u2018\u2018directed to the defendant\u2019\u2019). Donitz will know, from the complaint, that he is also a defendant, but he has not received an order from the court to appear and defend. His objection is a tad technical, but if there is one area in which the courts require dotting the \u2018\u2018i\u2019\u2019\u2019s and crossing the \u2018\u2018t\u2019\u2019\u2019s, it is likely to be initial service of process.

Erie clearly requires the federal court to apply state law to his claim, but which state\u2019s law, Pennsylvania\u2019s\u2014where the accident happened\u2014or New York\u2019s, where the case was filed? Because the case has connections with both states, each would have a basis for applying its own law to it. How is the federal court to choose between the two bodies of state tort law? Every state has \u2018\u2018choice-of-law\u2019\u2019 rules to deal with this problem, which arises frequently in state cases as well as federal diversity cases. For example, for many years the states used the \u2018\u2018lex loci delicti\u2019\u2019 choice-of-law rule in tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of injury, even if the suit were filed in a different state. Similarly, in contracts cases, traditional choice-of-law doctrine looked to the contract law of the place where the contract was formed. After Erie established that federal diversity courts had to apply state law, federal courts faced the further problem of choosing which state\u2019s law to use in a case like Erie. Should federal courts develop their own \u2018\u2018choice-of-law\u2019\u2019 rules for diversity cases, or borrow from the states? Three years after Erie, the Supreme Court addressed this issue in Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941). Klaxon held that a federal diversity court should use the choice-of-law rules of the state in which it sits. Thus, a New York federal court should apply whatever state substantive law the New York state court would apply to the case. If a New York court, under its choice-of-law rules, would apply New York tort law to Tompkins\u2019s accident (even though it took place in Pennsylvania), the New York federal court should do so as well. On the other hand, if a New York court would, under its choice-of-law rule for torts, apply Pennsylvania law to Tompkins\u2019s case, the New York federal court should similarly look to Pennsylvania law. Klaxon reasoned that Erie required that the case come out the same way in federal court that it would in the state courts of the state where the federal court sat. To further that uniformity goal, the federal court should choose whatever body of tort law (or contract law or other state law) the local state court would. When Erie was decided, most courts applied the lex loci delicti choice of law rule to tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of the injury. Under the lex loci rule, there was little doubt that, if a New York state court heard Tompkins\u2019s case, it would apply Pennsylvania tort law to it. So a federal court in New York would also look to Pennsylvania tort law to decide the case. Today, however, states use widely divergent choice-of-law rules. One state might use the place-of-the-injury rule in a tort case, another might look to the interests of the various states connected to the case, and another state might apply its own law as long as the case has some connection to it. It is entirely possible, under this balkanized approach to choice of law, that a New York court would apply New York law to a case, even though, had the case been filed in Pennsylvania, that court would have chosen its law\u2014or that of a third state\u2014to govern the same case. Since New York courts and Pennsylvania courts might apply different bodies of tort law to a case, it follows, under Klaxon, that federal courts in those states might also end up applying different tort rules to the same dispute. If the New York federal court uses New York\u2019s choice of law rules to select the proper tort law (as it must under Klaxon), it might select New York law in a case like Tompkins\u2019s, because a New York state court would, under its choice-of-law rules. But, if Pennsylvania uses different choice of law rules, a Pennsylvania federal court using Pennsylvania choice of law rules might apply Pennsylvania law, if Tompkins sued there. So Tompkins\u2019s lawyers might find, even now, that by selecting a federal court in one state rather than another, they can still shop for more favorable law, since the federal court in each state will use local choice-of-law rules to select the applicable substantive law. The Klaxon Court recognized that its holding posed this risk, but shrugged it off as inevitable: Whatever lack of uniformity this may produce between federal courts in different states is attributable to our federal system, which leaves to a state, within the limits permitted by the Constitution, the right to pursue local policies diverging from those of its neighbors. 313 U.S. at 496. So, the bottom line is that a federal diversity court must apply whatever state law the courts of the state in which it sits would apply. In cases with connections to more than one state, this adds a second layer to the Erie analysis.", "In Hanna, the Court addressed the power of Congress to promulgate rules that govern procedure in the federal courts. See 380 U.S. at 464. Analytically, it had to do so, because the power to write the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is granted by Congress to the Court, in the Rules Enabling Act. Surely, Congress could not delegate to the Court any broader rule-making power than it possesses itself. In Hanna, the Court describes Congress\u2019s rule-making authority as follows: the constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. That\u2019s a mighty broad test for Congressional power over federal court procedure: If the provision can rationally be viewed as regulating procedure, Congress may enact it, even if it will affect the outcome of litigation.

The York/Hanna doctrine is hard. So the Closer here is just another Closer. Consider again the two prongs of the Hanna analysis in choosing the best answer.  That is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer. But Hanna changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In Hanna, Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule. York and Byrd both involved such conflicts. York involved a conflict between a state statute and the judicial practice of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And Byrd involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal judicial practice of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these \u2018\u2018relatively unguided\u2019\u2019 Erie conflicts, Hanna reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in Byrd\u2019s language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because \u2018\u2018there can be no other law.\u2019\u2019 Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury\u2019s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy Erie sought to further\u2014uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts\u2014but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the Hanna opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of York\u2019s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are not prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and \u2018\u2018inequitable administration of the laws,\u2019\u2019 that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York line of cases would not require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following Question 1.) That\u2019s Hanna Part I. It\u2019s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in Hanna, unlike in York or in Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna construed Congress\u2019s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is \u2018\u2018rationally capable of classification\u2019\u2019 as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the \u2018\u2018outcome-determinative\u2019\u2019 test of York, or the more refined outcome-determinative test of Hanna Part I. But the rule involved in Hanna wasn\u2019t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to \u2018\u2018prescribe general rules of practice and procedure\u2019\u2019 for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a). In Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress\u2019s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted \u00a72072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that \u2018\u2018really regulates procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\u2019\u2019 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress\u2019s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress\u2019s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court\u2019s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b) provides that the Rules \u2018\u2018shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u2019\u2019 Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, \u00a72072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \u00a72072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and\u2014even if it is\u2014it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the \u2018\u2018modified outcome-determinative test\u2019\u2019 of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the \u2018\u2018Supreme Law of the Land.\u2019\u2019 United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under Hanna Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under Hanna Part II?

Curtiss, 7 U.S. 267 (1806). In 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(b), Congress sought to preserve the Kroger limit on supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases. Section 1367(b). In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332. This provision is the source of most student confusion concerning supplemental jurisdiction. Basically, it provides that in diversity cases only, the federal court will not have supplemental jurisdiction over certain claims by plaintiffs or persons sought to be joined as plaintiffs. Not all claims, just some claims, defined in \u00a71367(b) by reference to the rules used to join them. The purpose for this exception to the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \u00a71367(a) is to prevent parties from evading the Strawbridge complete diversity rule. Under that rule, a plaintiff in a diversity case can\u2019t sue defendants from her own state. If she could achieve the same result by suing a diverse defendant and then using supplemental jurisdiction to add a claim against one who is not diverse, Strawbridge would be a dead letter. Some think it should be a dead letter, but Congress evidently doesn\u2019t. So \u00a71367(b) enumerates certain situations in which a plaintiff in a diversity case cannot rely on supplemental jurisdiction to assert additional claims, even if they arise out of the same case or controversy under \u00a71367(a). Section 1367(b) isn\u2019t too bad if you approach it in steps. \u2022 First, ask if jurisdiction over the main claim is based solely on diversity. If it isn\u2019t, stop!

Suppose that Currier and Ives were injured in an accident, and sued Hochstein. If Currier\u2019s damages were $120,000, and Ives\u2019s were $25,000, Currier would satisfy the amount in controversy requirement in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a)(1), but Ives would not. Ives could not add his damages together with Currier\u2019s, and argue the case was for $145,000: he had to assert a claim himself for more than $75,000. Similarly, if a plaintiff sued multiple defendants, she had to assert a colorable claim for more than $75,000 against each defendant. Suppose Currier sued Hochstein for $60,000 in business losses, and claimed that he was entitled to double damages under an unfair business practices statute. He might recover a total of $120,000 on these claims, so he met the amount requirement. Now suppose that Currier made Faust a second defendant, seeking recovery of the same business losses, but the double damages statute did not apply to Faust. Because Currier only had a $60,000 claim against Faust, he did not satisfy the amount requirement against her. Again, he had to meet the amount in controversy requirement separately against each defendant. When Congress enacted the supplemental jurisdiction statute, it probably did not intend to change either of those rules. However, the text of \u00a71367 appears to change one of them. The question below illustrates the problem, which the Supreme Court addressed at length in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, 545 U.S. 546 (2005). In analyzing the problem, focus ruthlessly on the language of the statute.", "Rule 8 contains simple, sensible provisions governing the defendant\u2019s responses to the allegations in the complaint. First, Rule 8(b) requires the defendant to admit or deny each of the allegations in the complaint. Usually, this is done paragraph by paragraph. Rule 10(b) requires that averments in the complaint be set forth in separate paragraphs. The defendant, in answering, must take a position on each of these allegations, by admitting those that are true, and denying those that aren\u2019t. Under Rule 8(b)(2), a \u2018\u2018denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.\u2019\u2019 If the defendant means to deny only a part of an allegation, she must specify what is true and deny only the parts that are not. Failing to deny an allegation constitutes an admission of it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6). The idea is that, if the parties plead conscientiously by the Rules, the parties and the court can compare the allegations in the complaint and the responses in the answer, and determine which issues are contested and which are agreed upon (and therefore need not be litigated). If all goes right, this simple pleading process can narrow the scope of the dispute considerably. The Rule also recognizes that the defendant may not know whether some allegations in the complaint are true or not. If she has grounds to deny them, she may do so, but if she just doesn\u2019t know, or doesn\u2019t have the information necessary to admit or deny at the time of pleading, she may respond that she \u2018\u2018lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation.\u2019\u2019 Fed.

Under Rule 8, the defendant is allowed to plead whatever defenses she has to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. She may take inconsistent positions about the facts or the law, and may raise multiple defenses without choosing among them. The defendant might, for example, deny that she was negligent, but also allege that the plaintiff was more negligent than she was and is therefore barred from recovery. She might deny that she had a contract with the plaintiff, raise as a second defense that she did not breach, and raise as a third defense that the statute of limitations bars recovery. Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn\u2019t required to stake her case on one of them. Although Rule 11(b)(3) requires support for affirmative defenses as well as factual allegations in the original complaint, it is unfortunately common for defendants to \u2018\u2018overplead\u2019\u2019 affirmative defenses.

Doubtless, counsel view the risk of sanctions for overpleading defenses as less grievous than the risk of waiving a defense by failing to assert it.

So we have a pre-closer and a closer. A party who sues a defendant on a claim within the limitations period may change theories, add new damages, or recast the factual basis of the claim through amendments, assuming that the amended allegations still are based on the same underlying facts, and that the judge allows the amendment. The amended allegations will \u2018\u2018relate back\u2019\u2019 to the date the original complaint was filed. If the claim asserted in the amended complaint would have been timely on that date, Rule 15(c)(1)(B) avoids any limitations problem. But suppose the amendment adds a new defendant to the case? Rule 15 has a separate, more abstruse provision, Rule 15(c)(1)(C), that deals with this twist. As an example, assume that Leroy sues Tele-Sell, a telemarketing firm, under a statute barring telemarketing calls to consumers who have placed their names on a state do-not-call list.

Perhaps the following question will help to sort out the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C).", "Rule 11(c)(2) is often referred to as the \u2018\u2018safe harbor\u2019\u2019 provision of Rule 11. This subsection is intended to limit court time spent on sanctions motions while at the same time providing an incentive to clean up dubious pleadings and other filings. Under Rule 11(c)(2) a party who concludes that allegations in an opponent\u2019s filing are sanctionable may draft a motion for sanctions, citing the offending allegations. However, the moving party does not file the motion with the court; she sends it (presumably, with a supporting memorandum explaining why the challenged allegations are sanctionable) to the offending party. The rule gives the offender 21 days to withdraw or correct the challenged items. If she does, that\u2019s the end of it; the offender has sailed into the safe harbor; the moving party will not file the motion and the court will not impose a sanction. If the offender does not correct or withdraw, then the party who sent the motion files it with the court, which will hear the motion and may not only impose a sanction for submitting the unsupported paper, but may also award the moving party expenses and fees for the motion. The logic of Rule 11(c)(2) is impeccable: Put the party on notice of the unwarranted allegations, let her clean it up or withdraw it, and get on with the real issues in the case without taking the court\u2019s time culling out the frivolous ones. One wonders, however, if the practice matches the theory. How often will a litigator, who after all drafted and submitted the paper, roll over and cry \u2018\u2018mea culpa!\u2019\u2019 when an unloved opponent brands her a rule breaker? It may be that many litigators, who tend to be a feisty lot, will succumb to the temptation to dig in their heels rather than recognize the error of their ways. This would be unfortunate, but one suspects that the aggressive litigator does not always resemble Judge Hand\u2019s Reasonable Person. Here\u2019s an interesting question on the point.", "There\u2019s a lot more to Rule 11 than we have covered so far. Let\u2019s round out the discussion with a Closer that\u2014if you want to nail it\u2014will force you do something many of my students resist to the teeth\u2014to actually read the rule. The answers to this Closer are all tucked in there somewhere. Think of it as a litigator\u2019s treasure hunt.  The previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments. They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important question: What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).)  Consider the dilemma for the drafters of Rule 11 when establishing ethical limits on asserting legal positions before the court. Surely, they don\u2019t want to prevent lawyers from arguing for legal positions that have not been recognized before. Then the law could never change, because lawyers would be subject to sanctions for arguing for change. Surely, the rule makers also would not want to bar lawyers from arguing for the overruling of established law, for the same reason. But they do want to rein in extravagant or outlandish legal arguments that waste the courts\u2019 time. Rule 11(b) walks this line by requiring that there be a \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous argument\u2019\u2019 for legal positions that are not currently recognized or would require the court to overrule current law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), an advocate certifies to the court that the legal positions taken in a pleading, motion or other paper are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), the party asserting a legal position must have a rational argument for the position asserted, a position that has not been definitively rejected by the courts of the jurisdiction so recently that nothing but obstinacy would lead a lawyer to try again. Such \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous\u2019\u2019 arguments might be based on precedents from other states, dissenting opinions, changes by the appellate courts of the relevant state in related areas of law, scholarly criticism of the current law, or other authority suggesting that change is warranted. If you are going to file a pleading, motion, or other paper that argues for a change in the law, but don\u2019t want to risk Rule 11 sanctions, think of it this way: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going out on a limb here. My position is contradicted by the cases. If the judge calls me in before the bench and asks why I should not be sanctioned for violating Rule 11(b)(2), what will I say?\u2019\u2019 You need to be ready with a credible explanation why your argument for change is justified by precedent or other authority. You might say, \u2018\u2018Yes, your honor, I know that I\u2019m arguing to overrule Flores v. Jones, the case on point from our state supreme court, but the Third Restatement of Torts now takes the position I advocate, and four states have recently adopted it.\u2019\u2019 Or, \u2018\u2018Yes, your Honor, I know our state supreme court ruled otherwise in 1934, but look at how many areas of tort law they have modified since. Recognizing this cause of action is supported by our court\u2019s consistent expansion of tort remedies for negligence, reflected in the following seven cases.\u2019\u2019 Arguments like those are \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous.\u2019\u2019 The advocate is not just saying, \u2018\u2018I think the law should be otherwise,\u2019\u2019 but pointing to legal authority that supports the argument. This is reasoned persuasive argument rather than stubborn refusal to face the music. Courts should not prevent that, and Rule 11(b) (2) does not either. Consider this question on the point.  Rule 11 also imposes constraints on the factual allegations made in a pleading or motion. Under Rule 11(b)(3), the party making factual allegations certifies that \u2018\u2018after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,\u2019\u2019 those allegations \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\u2019\u2019 The basic standard, that the factual contentions \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support,\u2019\u2019 mandates that counsel have looked into the facts and have credible evidence in support of each fact alleged in her court filings. This standard clearly does not require that the evidence available at the time of filing the paper clearly establishes the fact alleged, or even makes it more probable than not that the fact is true. It requires that counsel have looked into the matter, and after doing so has some preliminary evidence in support of the allegation. That\u2019s a pretty indulgent standard, yet it does bar the tempting practice of filing papers without evidence and then casting about to find some later down the line. That is a temptation to busy counsel that Rule 11(b)(3) is meant to discourage. Consider this example. To nail it, take a look at Rule 11(c)(1) as well as Rule 11(b). ", "There\u2019s a lot more to Rule 11 than we have covered so far. Let\u2019s round out the discussion with a Closer that\u2014if you want to nail it\u2014will force you do something many of my students resist to the teeth\u2014to actually read the rule. The answers to this Closer are all tucked in there somewhere. Think of it as a litigator\u2019s treasure hunt.  The previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments. They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important question: What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).)  Consider the dilemma for the drafters of Rule 11 when establishing ethical limits on asserting legal positions before the court. Surely, they don\u2019t want to prevent lawyers from arguing for legal positions that have not been recognized before. Then the law could never change, because lawyers would be subject to sanctions for arguing for change. Surely, the rule makers also would not want to bar lawyers from arguing for the overruling of established law, for the same reason. But they do want to rein in extravagant or outlandish legal arguments that waste the courts\u2019 time. Rule 11(b) walks this line by requiring that there be a \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous argument\u2019\u2019 for legal positions that are not currently recognized or would require the court to overrule current law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), an advocate certifies to the court that the legal positions taken in a pleading, motion or other paper are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), the party asserting a legal position must have a rational argument for the position asserted, a position that has not been definitively rejected by the courts of the jurisdiction so recently that nothing but obstinacy would lead a lawyer to try again. Such \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous\u2019\u2019 arguments might be based on precedents from other states, dissenting opinions, changes by the appellate courts of the relevant state in related areas of law, scholarly criticism of the current law, or other authority suggesting that change is warranted. If you are going to file a pleading, motion, or other paper that argues for a change in the law, but don\u2019t want to risk Rule 11 sanctions, think of it this way: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going out on a limb here. My position is contradicted by the cases. If the judge calls me in before the bench and asks why I should not be sanctioned for violating Rule 11(b)(2), what will I say?\u2019\u2019 You need to be ready with a credible explanation why your argument for change is justified by precedent or other authority. You might say, \u2018\u2018Yes, your honor, I know that I\u2019m arguing to overrule Flores v. Jones, the case on point from our state supreme court, but the Third Restatement of Torts now takes the position I advocate, and four states have recently adopted it.\u2019\u2019 Or, \u2018\u2018Yes, your Honor, I know our state supreme court ruled otherwise in 1934, but look at how many areas of tort law they have modified since. Recognizing this cause of action is supported by our court\u2019s consistent expansion of tort remedies for negligence, reflected in the following seven cases.\u2019\u2019 Arguments like those are \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous.\u2019\u2019 The advocate is not just saying, \u2018\u2018I think the law should be otherwise,\u2019\u2019 but pointing to legal authority that supports the argument. This is reasoned persuasive argument rather than stubborn refusal to face the music. Courts should not prevent that, and Rule 11(b) (2) does not either. Consider this question on the point.  Rule 11 also imposes constraints on the factual allegations made in a pleading or motion. Under Rule 11(b)(3), the party making factual allegations certifies that \u2018\u2018after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,\u2019\u2019 those allegations \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\u2019\u2019 The basic standard, that the factual contentions \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support,\u2019\u2019 mandates that counsel have looked into the facts and have credible evidence in support of each fact alleged in her court filings.

In studying personal jurisdiction, we read common law cases in which the defendant \u2018\u2018appears specially\u2019\u2019 to object to jurisdiction. Then we study pleadings and motions under the Federal Rules, and along comes a different approach to jurisdictional objections. It\u2019s easy enough to mix them up. The special appearance was the common law\u2019s rather formalistic approach to raising objections to personal jurisdiction.

She could, for example, move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to join an indispensable party. If she raised those two objections in a jurisdiction that adheres to the older special appearance approach, she would be deemed to waive her objection to personal jurisdiction by also raising an issue that is presumably only relevant if the court has jurisdiction.

P. 81(c)(1).", "When the Federal Rules were adopted in 1938, they contained no provision dealing with discovery of \u2018\u2018work product,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018trial preparation materials.\u2019\u2019 However, as the federal courts gained experience with the broad right to discovery introduced by the Rules, they were frequently called upon to protect documents developed in the course of representation by lawyers or their agents. For example, a lawyer might be asked to produce a statement she had taken from a witness to the events in suit, or an index she had made of a file containing large numbers of documents in a client\u2019s possession, or a memo to a partner stating which documents in the client\u2019s files were relevant to the opposing party\u2019s claim. Such documents, created in the course of representation and for the purpose of preparing the case, are clearly relevant to the issues in the case, under Rule 26(b)(1). Yet allowing discovery of these materials would severely impact lawyers\u2019 practices, since they could reveal counsel\u2019s case evaluation and trial strategy to the opposing party. In Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947), the Supreme Court held that such \u2018\u2018attorney work product\u2019\u2019 should be protected from disclosure, at least absent a showing of a particular need for the information and inability to obtain it through other means. The Court was concerned that discovery of trial preparation materials would interfere with lawyers\u2019 ability to develop their case strategy in private, and lead lawyers to build their cases by forcing disclosure of opposing counsel\u2019s efforts rather than undertaking their own. Thus, the Court created a limited objection to shield work product materials from discovery. This is an additional limit on access to materials, even if they satisfy the broad relevance standard in Rule 26(b)(1). In 1970, Rule 26(b)(3), entitled \u2018\u2018Trial Preparation: Materials\u2019\u2019 was added to the Federal Rules. That Rule partially codifies the protection Hickman provided to work product materials. Under Rule 26(b)(3), trial preparation materials are protected from discovery if three criteria are met. The materials must be \u2018\u2018documents or tangible things.\u2019\u2019 They must be \u2018\u2018prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial,\u2019\u2019 and they must be prepared \u2018\u2018by or for another party or its representative. . . .\u2019\u2019 If these criteria are met, the materials need not ordinarily be produced in discovery. So, the first issue to consider in analyzing a claim of work product protection is whether the materials are presumptively protected. That depends on the three criteria in Rule 26(b)(3)(A). Not all documents in the possession of a lawyer are trial preparation materials. Suppose, for example, that Jackson is defending the City police department on a charge of unlawful arrest, and the chief of police sends him a copy of the booking sheet concerning the arrest and the arresting officer\u2019s report about the incident that gave rise to the arrest. These are not trial preparation materials. They are \u2018\u2018documents or tangible things,\u2019\u2019 and they are prepared by or for another party (the police department) but they are not \u2018\u2018prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\u2019\u2019 They are simply the general business records of the police department, made as a matter of routine in every case, whether litigation may follow or not. Although they were sent to counsel in the course of defending the case, that is not enough to make them work product. If it were, all documents would be shielded from discovery simply because they were sent to counsel. If a document meets the criteria for work product under Rule 26(b) (3)(A), the presumptive protection for such materials may still be overcome in some circumstances. Under the rule, the court may order production of protected materials if the party seeking them shows that it has \u2018\u2018substantial need for the materials to prepare its case\u2019\u2019 and cannot obtain their substantial equivalent by other means. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3)(A)(ii). However, even if the requesting party cannot otherwise obtain the material, some items may not be discoverable under Rule 26(b)(3). Work product need not be produced, even if a substantial need is shown, if it would reveal \u2018\u2018the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party\u2019s attorney or other representative concerning the litigation.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(B). It may be helpful to think of Rule 26(b)(3) in terms of a decision tree: Step #1: Is the material a document or tangible thing? Was it prepared by or for another party? Was it prepared in anticipation of litigation? If the answer to these questions is \u2018\u2018yes,\u2019\u2019 the document enjoys presumptive protection under Rule 26(b)(3). Then go on to Step #2. Step #2: Does the requesting party have a substantial need for the material in preparing its case? Is it unable to obtain equivalent information by other means? If the answer to both questions is \u2018\u2018yes,\u2019\u2019 it will have to be produced despite presumptive work product protection. . . . unless . . . Step #3: Would the material reveal the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of counsel? If yes, such opinions, etc., will be protected from discovery in almost all cases, despite surviving Steps #1 and #2. This protection for trial preparation materials in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3) is usually referred to as the \u2018\u2018work product doctrine,\u2019\u2019 or the \u2018\u2018protection for trial preparation material,\u2019\u2019 rather than as a privilege. This reflects the fact that work product protection, unlike a privilege, can be outweighed, under Hickman or under Rule 26(b)(3), by a sufficient showing of need. But the doctrine is loosely referred to as a privilege in a good many opinions, and in at least some situations it is treated as one. Consider, in the following example, whether the material requested satisfies the Rule 26(b)(3) standard for \u2018\u2018trial preparation materials.\u2019\u2019", "When the Federal Rules were adopted in 1938, they contained no provision dealing with discovery of \u2018\u2018work product,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018trial preparation materials.\u2019\u2019 However, as the federal courts gained experience with the broad right to discovery introduced by the Rules, they were frequently called upon to protect documents developed in the course of representation by lawyers or their agents.

For example, in Hickman, opposing counsel sought production of Fortenbaugh\u2019s recollections of his interviews with witnesses, as well as his notes of other interviews. Rule 26(b)(3) would not protect this information, since it is not a \u2018\u2018document or tangible thing.\u2019\u2019 It isn\u2019t clear why the rulemakers, in drafting Rule 26(b)(3), chose to address only work product objections to production of documents and tangible things. It might be argued that, since they chose to protect these from disclosure (unless the appropriate showing is made), by implication, other work product\u2014that is, intangible work product like Fortenbaugh\u2019s recollections of witness interviews\u2014are not protected. However, this has not been the reading of the courts. Most courts have held that intangible work product continues to enjoy protection under standards established in the Hickman case itself. Thus, they need not be produced absent some showing of extraordinary need. See, e.g., Sporck v. Peil, 759 F.2d 312 (3d Cir. 1985). And \u2018\u2018opinion work product\u2019\u2019\u2014the mental impressions of counsel\u2014is probably protected from disclosure in almost all cases. So, consider the following worthy Closer.  A good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties\u2019 relative access to relevant information, the parties\u2019 resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of \u2018\u2018any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.\u2019\u2019 In an effort to rein in discovery, the \u2018\u2018relevant to the claim or defense of any party\u2019\u2019 language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to \u2018\u2018the subject matter of the pending action,\u2019\u2019 but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called \u2018\u2018proportionality factors\u2019\u2019 in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the \u2018\u2018relevant to a claim or defense in the action\u2019\u2019 standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff\u2019s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants\u2019 arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is discoverable even though it isn\u2019t admissible as evidence at a trial. \u2018\u2018Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\u2019\u2019 For example, statements that are \u2018\u2018hearsay,\u2019\u2019 that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here\u2019s a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).  Because the standard for relevance in Rule 26(b)(1), as amended in 2000, is tied to the claims and defenses in the case, the parties\u2019 pleadings play an important role in determining the scope of discovery. By raising issues in the pleadings, the parties lay themselves open to discovery on issues which otherwise might remain free from inquiry. Prior to the amendment, the pleadings were less central to the scope of discovery, since any information relevant to \u2018\u2018the subject matter of the action,\u2019\u2019 rather than the \u2018\u2018claims or defenses\u2019\u2019 raised by the parties was subject to discovery. In the following question, consider whether the information sought is relevant to the claims and defenses of the parties.    ", "If a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement? Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This \u2018\u2018aggregation\u2019\u2019 problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot \u2018\u2018aggregate\u2019\u2019 claims against different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a \u2018\u2018common, undivided interest.\u2019\u2019 (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at Chapter 14, pp. 279-283. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.", "If a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement?

As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.  Frequently, a plaintiff sues two or more defendants on a tort claim for injuries arguably worth more than $75,000. Suppose, for example, that Epstein suffers nerve damage during surgery, and that the damages are $90,000. He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith\u2019s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe\u2019s fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe \u2018\u2018jointly and severally liable\u2019\u2019 for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence. But the amount requirement would be met in either type of jurisdiction. As long as either defendant might be held liable for the full $90,000, that amount is \u2018\u2018in controversy\u2019\u2019 between her and the plaintiff. Since either Smith or Doe might be found solely at fault, either might be held liable for the full $90,000.

To illustrate: ", "In large scale litigation these days, many problems are posed by the fact that the \u2018\u2018documents\u2019\u2019 parties need are in electronic form. \u2018\u2018It is estimated that over 90 percent of all business information is created electronically and never printed out.\u2019\u20194 Computers have facilitated the creation, storage and retrieval of vast amounts of information. When litigation eventuates, opposing lawyers generally want it all. In big cases, this can make discovery hugely expensive and especially contentious. The Federal Rules now contain several provisions to assist judges in handling the problems posed by electronic discovery: \u2022 Rules 33(d) and 34(a)(1)(A) expressly provide that \u2018\u2018electronically stored information\u2019\u2019 is subject to discovery. There has never been much doubt that such information is discoverable, but it\u2019s clear now that it is. \u2022 Rule 26(b)(2)(B) provides that parties need not provide electronic information that is \u2018\u2018not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost.\u2019\u2019 The burden falls on the party who objects on this basis to show that the information is not reasonably accessible. If the party carries that burden, the court may still order production, but only for good cause and under appropriate provisions (such as cost sharing). This emphasizes that the burden of producing information is an important factor in limiting discovery and calls on the judge to make careful judgments about whether and how much of this information must be produced. \u2022 Rule 37\u2014which addresses sanctions for inadequate participation in discovery\u2014expressly addresses failure to preserve electronically stored information relevant to anticipated or current litigation. Rule 37(e)(1) authorizes the court to impose orders\u2014 such as measures to retrieve the information, allowing evidence of the loss of the information, or barring evidence about a claim or defense to which the missing evidence is relevant. For intentional destruction of such evidence, Rule 37(e)(2) allows more drastic sanctions, up to and including a default judgment or dismissal of a violator\u2019s claim. \u2022 Rule 26(b)(5)(B) addresses another problem intensified by electronic discovery. Because parties often produce huge masses of material in electronic discovery exchanges, they will sometimes discover that, without meaning to, they have produced documents that were privileged or subject to work product protection. Rule 26(b)(5)(B) allows a party who has made such an \u2018\u2018inadvertent disclosure\u2019\u2019 to notify the receiving party of the mistake. If so notified, the receiving party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim [of privilege or work product protection]. The producing party must preserve the information until the claim is resolved. This provision attempts to freeze the status quo until the producing party\u2019s claim of privilege can be resolved. It does not provide that the information is still privileged despite its inadvertent production; rather, it bars any use of it until a court determines whether producing it in discovery has waived the right to keep it confidential. The question below probes the meaning of this quizzical provision.", "A deposition is the examination of a witness under oath. Depositions are the most effective means of previewing the detailed testimony of witnesses. The party wishing to depose the witness sends a notice of the deposition to the deponent and to all other parties. If the deponent is not a party, a subpoena must also be sent to ensure the witness\u2019s attendance. The subpoena is a court order to appear and give testimony. A witness who ignores it may be punished by the court. (Parties do not have to be subpoenaed, because they are already before the court and subject to the rules of discovery and to court orders enforcing them.) Depositions serve several purposes. They \u2018\u2018get the witness on the record.\u2019\u2019 That is, the witness tells her story under oath. If she contradicts that story at trial, she can be impeached with her deposition testimony. Depositions also allow deposing counsel to learn what the witness knows and to ask follow-up questions to get the details of what the witness knows. In addition, taking a witness\u2019s deposition gives opposing counsel the opportunity to look the witness in the eye, to form a judgment about her credibility and about how she will likely perform as a witness at trial. Ordinarily, parties will depose the other side\u2019s witnesses rather than their own. After all, they can talk to their own witnesses privately, without revealing the witness\u2019s testimony or counsel\u2019s line of reasoning by the questions they ask. For the same reason, counsel do not usually cross-examine in detail at a deposition, except to clarify points on which the deponent\u2019s testimony may create a misimpression. However, in some cases a party may depose a witness in order to obtain the party\u2019s testimony for use at trial. If, for example, a witness is moving out of the country, the party who wants to use that witness\u2019s testimony at trial may take her deposition as a substitute for her live testimony at the trial. The deposition will be admissible at trial if the witness is not available to testify in person. Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(4). Note that in this scenario, unlike the typical deposition, the party noticing the deposition will be the party who plans to use that witness\u2019s testimony, not the opposing party. Consider what the plaintiff\u2019s counsel should do in the following scenario.", "A deposition is the examination of a witness under oath.

Ordinarily, parties will depose the other side\u2019s witnesses rather than their own. After all, they can talk to their own witnesses privately, without revealing the witness\u2019s testimony or counsel\u2019s line of reasoning by the questions they ask. For the same reason, counsel do not usually cross-examine in detail at a deposition, except to clarify points on which the deponent\u2019s testimony may create a misimpression. However, in some cases a party may depose a witness in order to obtain the party\u2019s testimony for use at trial. If, for example, a witness is moving out of the country, the party who wants to use that witness\u2019s testimony at trial may take her deposition as a substitute for her live testimony at the trial. The deposition will be admissible at trial if the witness is not available to testify in person. Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(4).

Consider what the plaintiff\u2019s counsel should do in the following scenario.", "A deposition is the examination of a witness under oath. Depositions are the most effective means of previewing the detailed testimony of witnesses. The party wishing to depose the witness sends a notice of the deposition to the deponent and to all other parties. If the deponent is not a party, a subpoena must also be sent to ensure the witness\u2019s attendance. The subpoena is a court order to appear and give testimony. A witness who ignores it may be punished by the court. (Parties do not have to be subpoenaed, because they are already before the court and subject to the rules of discovery and to court orders enforcing them.) Depositions serve several purposes. They \u2018\u2018get the witness on the record.\u2019\u2019 That is, the witness tells her story under oath. If she contradicts that story at trial, she can be impeached with her deposition testimony.

This requirement seems arbitrary and technical, even silly. But let\u2019s try to understand why courts have consistently included this mysterious limitation on collateral estoppel. Cambria v. Jeffrey, 307 Mass. 49 (1940), provides a classic example of the problem. In slightly simplified form, the facts were as follows: Cambria had an accident with Jeffrey and sued Jeffrey for negligence in causing his injuries. Jeffrey pleaded contributory negligence. At the time of this crusty case, contributory negligence of a plaintiff barred recovery entirely, even if the defendant was negligent too. The case was tried before a judge, not a jury. The judge found that Cambria was negligent, and that Jeffrey was negligent as well. Question: What judgment should the judge enter based on these factual findings? He should dismiss Cambria\u2019s suit. Under the contributory negligence doctrine, a plaintiff who was partially at fault in causing the accident could not recover. The plaintiff had to be blameless to recover, and Cambria was negligent, so he lost. But that wasn\u2019t the end of it. After the judge dismissed Cambria\u2019s suit, Jeffrey sued Cambria for his injuries. (At the time Massachusetts had no compulsory counterclaim rule, so Jeffrey had not waived his claim by failing to assert it in the first action.) Predictably, Cambria pleaded that Jeffrey was contributorily negligent, and asserted that Jeffrey was estopped from denying his negligence, since the judge in the first suit had found that he was. This isn\u2019t a bad argument; the parties litigated Jeffrey\u2019s negligence in Suit One, and the judge decided that he was negligent, so why should Jeffrey be allowed to litigate it again? Despite this logic, the court in Cambria v. Jeffrey held that Jeffrey could litigate it again, because the judge\u2019s finding in the first suit that Jeffrey was negligent was not \u2018\u2018necessary to the judgment.\u2019\u2019 Question: What finding was necessary to the judgment in Suit One? Why did Cambria lose? If you think about it, it\u2019s clear that Cambria did not lose because Jeffrey was negligent . . . that finding would tend to support liability! No, he lost because he (Cambria) was negligent. At the time, a contributorily negligent plaintiff could not win, whether the defendant was negligent or not. Thus, Cambria\u2019s negligence led to the judgment, but the finding that Jeffrey was negligent was irrelevant to the outcome in the first action. Because the judge in the first action never had to decide whether Jeffrey was negligent, that finding was a form of dicta. The finding didn\u2019t affect the outcome, so the judge may not have given it the same serious consideration he would have if it would affect the result. Thus, we can\u2019t have quite the level of confidence in this irrelevant conclusion that we have in a finding that leads to the judgment in the case. There\u2019s another problem with findings that don\u2019t lead to the judgment. They are, usually, unreviewable: Question: Put yourself in Jeffrey\u2019s shoes. The judge has found him negligent. He contemplates a suit against Cambria for his own injuries in the accident. What would he want to do if he feared that he would be estopped from relitigating his negligence in the second action? Naturally, if Jeffrey fears being stuck with the finding that he was negligent, he would want to appeal it and get it reversed, so it would not come back to haunt him in his later suit for his own injuries. Question: If Jeffrey appealed the judge\u2019s finding in the first action that he was negligent, what would the appellate court do? Very likely, the appellate court would say, \u2018\u2018What are you doing here, Jeffrey? You won below. Why should we review the finding that you were negligent? The issue is moot. Even if we agreed with you, it wouldn\u2019t change the outcome, so why should we waste our time reviewing an irrelevant conclusion?\u2019\u2019 And how could they meaningfully review it? If Jeffrey appealed, why would Cambria spend the money to oppose the appeal? He lost anyway, he isn\u2019t likely to litigate an appeal about Jeffrey\u2019s negligence out of pure curiosity. So, Jeffrey would probably not be able to obtain appellate review of the trial judge\u2019s finding that he was negligent. Since the finding did not affect the outcome, and can\u2019t be corrected on appeal, most courts would not give collateral estoppel effect to it. The trick, of course, is to distinguish such miscellaneous findings from those that do affect the outcome, that are \u2018\u2018necessary to the judgment.\u2019\u2019 Consider this case.", "The cases we\u2019ve analyzed so far have involved situations in which one of the parties to Suit One invokes collateral estoppel in a later action between the same parties. Suppose, for example, that Smith sues Doe, and loses on Issue A. The same issue then arises again in a later suit between Smith and Doe, and Doe invokes collateral estoppel to bar Smith from relitigating it. This is a case of \u2018\u2018mutual collateral estoppel,\u2019\u2019 because Doe, the party invoking estoppel in the second action was a party to the first, litigated it against Smith in that action, and prevailed on the issue in Suit One. However, an issue previously litigated and decided may arise in later litigation involving a new party as well. Suppose, for example, that Forrestal Corporation sues Quantum Software for infringing its patent, and loses because the jury finds that the patent is invalid. Subsequently, Forrestal sues Apex Corporation for infringing on the patent. Apex would like to invoke collateral estoppel, arguing that Forrestal litigated and lost on the patent issue in Suit One and should not be able to relitigate the issue. Under traditional principles of collateral estoppel, Apex could not invoke estoppel, because it was not a party to the first suit. Under the \u2018\u2018mutuality\u2019\u2019 doctrine, which still reigns in some jurisdictions, only the parties to the first action could invoke estoppel based on findings in that action. Apex, a stranger to Suit One, could not step in and use the finding from that suit to bar Forrestal from relitigating the validity issue. Other courts have moved away from mutuality, recognizing that, under some conditions, allowing a new party to invoke estoppel is fair. The key case on the point is Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979), in which the Supreme Court cautiously authorized federal trial judges to apply non-mutual estoppel in circumstances that ensure that the issue was fairly decided in the first action. However, while the federal courts and a good many state courts now allow non-mutual estoppel, all courts adhere to a fundamental requirement: that the party who is being estopped must have litigated and lost on the issue in the prior suit. The party invoking estoppel may be new, but the party who is barred from relitigating must have had its fair bite at the apple in the first suit. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to invoke estoppel to bar her from litigating the issue. In analyzing a non-mutual preclusion problem, start by asking who litigated the issues in the prior action. In a mutuality jurisdiction, only those parties may use estoppel in a later action. In a non-mutuality jurisdiction, estoppel can be used against a party who litigated and lost on an issue in the first suit. Here\u2019s a case that makes the point.", "The cases we\u2019ve analyzed so far have involved situations in which one of the parties to Suit One invokes collateral estoppel in a later action between the same parties. Suppose, for example, that Smith sues Doe, and loses on Issue A. The same issue then arises again in a later suit between Smith and Doe, and Doe invokes collateral estoppel to bar Smith from relitigating it. This is a case of \u2018\u2018mutual collateral estoppel,\u2019\u2019 because Doe, the party invoking estoppel in the second action was a party to the first, litigated it against Smith in that action, and prevailed on the issue in Suit One. However, an issue previously litigated and decided may arise in later litigation involving a new party as well. Suppose, for example, that Forrestal Corporation sues Quantum Software for infringing its patent, and loses because the jury finds that the patent is invalid. Subsequently, Forrestal sues Apex Corporation for infringing on the patent. Apex would like to invoke collateral estoppel, arguing that Forrestal litigated and lost on the patent issue in Suit One and should not be able to relitigate the issue. Under traditional principles of collateral estoppel, Apex could not invoke estoppel, because it was not a party to the first suit. Under the \u2018\u2018mutuality\u2019\u2019 doctrine, which still reigns in some jurisdictions, only the parties to the first action could invoke estoppel based on findings in that action. Apex, a stranger to Suit One, could not step in and use the finding from that suit to bar Forrestal from relitigating the validity issue. Other courts have moved away from mutuality, recognizing that, under some conditions, allowing a new party to invoke estoppel is fair. The key case on the point is Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979), in which the Supreme Court cautiously authorized federal trial judges to apply non-mutual estoppel in circumstances that ensure that the issue was fairly decided in the first action. However, while the federal courts and a good many state courts now allow non-mutual estoppel, all courts adhere to a fundamental requirement: that the party who is being estopped must have litigated and lost on the issue in the prior suit.

But it is useful to introduce the problem of cases that include some claims that satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction, but also others that do not. Very commonly, cases involve not one claim, but several\u2014perhaps two, or perhaps ten. Civil procedure has a nasty doctrine called res judicata, which provides that once you have sued a defendant for claims arising out of a set of events, you can\u2019t do it again. Consequently, lawyers know that whatever claims they have against a defendant arising from a particular dispute must be asserted when they bring suit the first time. Suppose, for example, that Greenstein, a New Yorker, sues Panil, another New Yorker, for infringing her patent, claiming that she had licensed Panil to use the patented device for limited purposes, but Panil had exceeded those limits. This claim arises under the federal patent statutes, so the federal court has arising-under jurisdiction to hear it. However, Greenstein might also allege a claim for breach of contract as well, based on the same acts by Panil. This is a state claim between two parties from the same state. It doesn\u2019t arise under federal law, and there\u2019s no diversity. If it were brought alone, the federal court would not have jurisdiction to hear it. But it wasn\u2019t brought alone; it was brought along with a proper federal claim and arises from the same events. It makes sense that it should be litigated along with the federal claim. But how can it be? Subject matter jurisdiction is fundamental, and what gives the federal court subject matter jurisdiction over Greenstein\u2019s contract claim? The Supreme Court has held that where the plaintiff asserts a claim that properly supports federal court jurisdiction, it is constitutionally permissible for the federal court to hear the entire dispute between the parties, including other claims that arise from the same \u2018\u2018nucleus of operative facts\u2019\u2019 but could not be brought in federal court alone. United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966). And Congress has conveyed such \u2018\u2018supplemental\u2019\u2019 jurisdiction to the federal district courts in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a), which authorizes the federal court, if it has jurisdiction over one claim, to hear other claims that are part of the same \u2018\u2018case or controversy.\u2019\u2019 Basically, a claim is part of the same case or controversy as the main claim (the one that gives the federal court jurisdiction) if it arises from the same set of underlying facts, the \u2018\u2018common nucleus of operative facts\u2019\u2019 test of Gibbs. So the bottom line is (a little oversimplified, but close enough until we get to Chapter 14) that a plaintiff who has asserted one substantial claim that properly invokes federal jurisdiction may have her entire dispute heard in federal court, including state law claims that couldn\u2019t otherwise be brought in federal court. Here\u2019s a basic illustration.", "Because the outer limits of federal subject matter jurisdiction are established in the Constitution, the federal courts are careful not to exceed those limits. Thus, they will almost always entertain objections to their jurisdiction, even if they were not raised at the outset of the case. See Fed. R. Civ.

Thus, for example, the parties cannot consent to the federal court hearing a case over which it lacks jurisdiction.

Consider the following question.", "My students always get confused about the relationship between removal to federal court and personal jurisdiction. Suppose that a defendant is sued in Arizona and believes that she is not subject to personal jurisdiction there. Naturally, she should object to personal jurisdiction. But suppose further that she isn\u2019t sure that her objection will carry the day; it\u2019s a close issue, as so many personal jurisdiction issues are under minimum contacts analysis. And suppose that her tactical judgment is that, if she must litigate in Arizona, she would rather litigate in federal court in Arizona. What should she do? One thing she could do is to move to dismiss in the Arizona state court. But that motion is not likely to be ruled on within thirty days, and if she\u2019s going to remove, she\u2019s got to do it within thirty days. So she could do one of two things: She could move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in the state court (assuming that the state rules allow her to do that) and then remove to federal court within the thirty-day period. Her motion would then be pending in federal court instead of state court, and the federal court would rule on it. Or she could remove the case before a response was due in state court, and then, after removal, raise her objection to personal jurisdiction by a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss or in her answer to the complaint in federal court. Either way, the point is that removal does not waive the defendant\u2019s right to object to personal jurisdiction. It simply changes the court in which the objection will be litigated. It is true that, after removal, the question will be whether the federal court has personal jurisdiction. But generally the scope of personal jurisdiction in the federal court will be the same as that of the state court, because the Federal Rules require the federal court in most cases to conform to state limits on personal jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A). I\u2019ve stumped a multitude of students on this point.

In fact, it continues to give rise to a great deal of fact-specific litigation, applying Shoe\u2019s general principles to the myriad facts of human experience. But the real kicker for my students has been the stream-of-commerce problem addressed\u2014or obfuscated\u2014in Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102 (1987) and revisited by the Court in J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro, 131 S. Ct. 2780 (2011). This section probes the meaning of so-called stream-of-commerce jurisdiction. \u2018\u2018Stream of commerce\u2019\u2019 is a phrase that refers to the entry of a defendant\u2019s products into the forum state through commercial channels of distribution. For example, suppose that Snoflake Incorporated makes snowblowers in Nevada and sells them to a wholesaler in Oregon, which resells them to retail stores in ten states, including Wyoming. If Wakimoto buys a Snoflake snowblower at a hardware store in Wyoming and is injured using it in Wyoming, will a Wyoming court have personal jurisdiction over Snowflake for his claim? Snoflake did not sell the snowblower in Wyoming itself. It may or may not have known that the wholesaler would resell its product there. But it did sell its product into the stream of commerce with the hope that it would be sold widely, and with knowledge that, if it was defective, it could injure a user wherever it was bought and used. And, of course, it cheerfully accepted the profits derived, ultimately, from sales in Wyoming. The stream-of-commerce question is whether Snoflake\u2019s sale of the product to the wholesaler in Oregon, with the hope and expectation that it would be resold to consumers in other states, establishes a sufficient contact with the final purchaser\u2019s state to support personal jurisdiction where Wakimoto buys and uses it and is injured by it. This is an important question, to which the Supreme Court has given only an equivocal answer. In World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson, the Court appeared to suggest that selling into the stream of commerce in one state, which leads to resale to consumers in a different state, would support jurisdiction there if the consumer was injured where she bought it (not where she took it, as World-Wide holds). See World-Wide, 444 U.S. at 297 (jurisdiction appropriate where injury results from manufacturer or distributor\u2019s efforts to \u2018\u2018serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in other states\u2019\u2019). But the Court later divided on this issue in Asahi. In Asahi, the defendant made a component that was incorporated into a final product in another country and resold into California. The question was whether the component maker had sufficient contacts with California to support jurisdiction, when a consumer bought the product there and was injured by it there. Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion suggested that a defendant that merely sold its product to another company, without controlling where that other company would redistribute it as part of its final product, was not subject to jurisdiction where the finished product was ultimately sold. Jurisdiction, Justice O\u2019Connor suggested, is based on purposeful availment, and the mere sale of a part\u2014or 100,000 parts\u2014from Japan to Taiwan did not establish minimum contacts with California. Instead, she would require that a defendant like Asahi actually establish direct contacts in the consumer\u2019s state to subject it to suit there for injuries caused by its products sold in the state. She would find such \u2018\u2018purposeful availment\u2019\u2019 if the defendant establishes sales agents in the state, advertises there, has dealership networks there, or makes other deliberate efforts, itself, to market its goods in the state of ultimate sale to the consumer. Justice Brennan\u2019s concurring opinion in Asahi, however, appeared to accept the principle that sales of large quantities of the defendant\u2019s product in an American state, even indirectly through the stream of commerce, would support jurisdiction in that state, if the plaintiff suffered injury there from the product. Justice Stevens, while finding it unnecessary to reach the minimum contacts question, also appeared inclined to find jurisdiction based on indirect sales in a state, depending on the nature and quantity of those sales. However, while the Justices could not agree on what constitutes \u2018\u2018purposeful availment\u2019\u2019 in a stream- of-commerce case, eight did agree that, even if minimum contacts existed, it would be unreasonable on the facts of the case for the California court to exercise jurisdiction over Asahi, since the dispute remaining after the plaintiff settled was a claim for indemnification between two Asian corporations. We Civil Procedure wonks waited long and anxiously\u2014for twenty- four years\u2014for the Court to clarify this vexing problem. Finally the Court took certiorari in J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873 (2011), and we looked forward to further wisdom on stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Alas, fooled again. The case involved a machine made in England, imported to a distributor in Ohio, and resold into New Jersey. Nicastro was injured there using the machine and brought suit against the English manufacturer in New Jersey. It argued, predictably, that it was not subject to personal jurisdiction for this claim in New Jersey, since it had done nothing in New Jersey at all; it had just made machines in England and sold them to a distributor in Ohio. In Nicastro the Court again split badly on the reach of stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Justice Kennedy\u2019s plurality opinion, joined by three other justices, concluded that J. McIntyre had not \u2018\u2018engaged in conduct purposely directed to New Jersey\u2019\u2019 (564 U.S. at 886) and therefore could not be sued in New Jersey for Nicastro\u2019s claim. Two justices filed a concurring opinion saying, essentially, \u2018\u2018no jurisdiction on these facts but we might rule differently if there were a regular course of sales into New Jersey, or deliberate efforts to cultivate the New Jersey market.\u2019\u2019 And three dissenters argued, vociferously, that J. McIntyre had sought to cultivate the United States market, had succeeded in doing so, and ought to defend the product in a state where it was resold to the ultimate user and caused injury. So, neither Asahi nor McIntyre provides clear guidance on the stream-of-commerce problem. There will be a lot of unclear cases, and expensive litigation of the jurisdiction issue in such cases will continue. Perhaps this is inevitable; perhaps the Justices have not given us a clear answer because there never can be one for a problem with so many possible variations. But the following questions may help you to at least define the parameters of the problem.", "Let\u2019s consider one more example that concerns the relation between minimum contacts and litigation convenience.", "Let\u2019s consider one more example that concerns the relation between minimum contacts and litigation convenience.", "Let\u2019s consider one more example that concerns the relation between minimum contacts and litigation convenience.", "Over the years from Pennoyer v. Neff to Shaffer v. Heitner, attachment jurisdiction was widely invoked to support jurisdiction over unrelated claims. It was routinely used, for example, to attach intangible assets, such as bank deposits. This expanded the doctrine beyond its traditional roots, which involved physical control of physical assets. It is harder to think of a bank account, which is a contractual right to repayment of the deposited amount, as physically \u2018\u2018present\u2019\u2019 in a particular place. Harris v. Balk, 198 U.S. 215 (1905), was an extreme example of the use of attachment jurisdiction to seize an intangible asset. In Harris, Epstein, a Maryland citizen with a claim against Balk, learned that Harris, who owed money to Balk, was coming to Maryland. Epstein sued Balk in Maryland, and obtained a writ of attachment for the seizure of Harris\u2019s debt to Balk. He then served the writ on Harris while he was in Maryland. The Supreme Court concluded that Harris\u2019s debt to Balk traveled with him, so that it could be \u2018\u2018seized\u2019\u2019 in Maryland while Harris was there, and disposed of by order of the Maryland court. This was an exercise of attachment, or quasi in rem type II jurisdiction, because Harris\u2019s debt to Balk was completely unrelated to Epstein\u2019s claim against Balk. It simply provided an unrelated asset that could be seized by the court and used to satisfy Epstein\u2019s claim. Shaffer involved a similarly extreme exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction. Heitner sued officers and directors of Greyhound Company in Delaware, asserting a claim arising out of alleged mismanagement of the company\u2019s business in Oregon. Many of the defendants had not acted in Delaware, and had no other connection to Delaware that would support personal jurisdiction over them there. But many of them owned Greyhound stock. And Delaware had a statute that declared all shares of stock in Delaware corporations to be present in Delaware. Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8, \u00a7169 (1975). So, Heitner sought\u2014and was granted\u2014a court order seizing (\u2018\u2018sequestering\u2019\u2019) the Greyhound stock owned by the defendants. Here, as in Harris v. Balk, Heitner did not claim any preexisting ownership interest in the stock itself. Rather, he sought to adjudicate an unrelated claim that arose in Oregon based on the court\u2019s seizure of these intangible assets. Like the plaintiff\u2019s ploy in Harris, this was an exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction\u2014very type II. In Shaffer, the Court held that the artificial distinction between exercising jurisdiction over the defendant and exercising jurisdiction over his property in quasi in rem type II cases \u2018\u2018supports an ancient form without substantial modern justification.\u2019\u2019 433 U.S. at 212. Because taking the defendants\u2019 property was merely an \u2018\u2018elliptical way\u2019\u2019 of asserting jurisdiction over the defendants themselves, the Court broadly concluded that it could only be asserted under the same standards: \u2018\u2018We therefore conclude that all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in International Shoe and its progeny.\u2019\u2019 433 U.S. at 212. If this broad language from Shaffer means what it says, it would allow the assertion of attachment jurisdiction only when the defendant could personally be sued in the state for the underlying claim, under in personam jurisdiction standards. For the moment, let\u2019s take the broad holding quoted above at face value. On that assumption, consider the following example.", "Over the years from Pennoyer v. Neff to Shaffer v.

Heitner sued officers and directors of Greyhound Company in Delaware, asserting a claim arising out of alleged mismanagement of the company\u2019s business in Oregon. Many of the defendants had not acted in Delaware, and had no other connection to Delaware that would support personal jurisdiction over them there. But many of them owned Greyhound stock. And Delaware had a statute that declared all shares of stock in Delaware corporations to be present in Delaware. Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8, \u00a7169 (1975). So, Heitner sought\u2014and was granted\u2014a court order seizing (\u2018\u2018sequestering\u2019\u2019) the Greyhound stock owned by the defendants. Here, as in Harris v. Balk, Heitner did not claim any preexisting ownership interest in the stock itself. Rather, he sought to adjudicate an unrelated claim that arose in Oregon based on the court\u2019s seizure of these intangible assets. Like the plaintiff\u2019s ploy in Harris, this was an exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction\u2014very type II.

For the moment, let\u2019s take the broad holding quoted above at face value. On that assumption, consider the following example.", "Over the years from Pennoyer v. Neff to Shaffer v. Heitner, attachment jurisdiction was widely invoked to support jurisdiction over unrelated claims. It was routinely used, for example, to attach intangible assets, such as bank deposits. This expanded the doctrine beyond its traditional roots, which involved physical control of physical assets. It is harder to think of a bank account, which is a contractual right to repayment of the deposited amount, as physically \u2018\u2018present\u2019\u2019 in a particular place. Harris v. Balk, 198 U.S. 215 (1905), was an extreme example of the use of attachment jurisdiction to seize an intangible asset. In Harris, Epstein, a Maryland citizen with a claim against Balk, learned that Harris, who owed money to Balk, was coming to Maryland. Epstein sued Balk in Maryland, and obtained a writ of attachment for the seizure of Harris\u2019s debt to Balk. He then served the writ on Harris while he was in Maryland. The Supreme Court concluded that Harris\u2019s debt to Balk traveled with him, so that it could be \u2018\u2018seized\u2019\u2019 in Maryland while Harris was there, and disposed of by order of the Maryland court. This was an exercise of attachment, or quasi in rem type II jurisdiction, because Harris\u2019s debt to Balk was completely unrelated to Epstein\u2019s claim against Balk. It simply provided an unrelated asset that could be seized by the court and used to satisfy Epstein\u2019s claim. Shaffer involved a similarly extreme exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction.

But federal courts exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants too. Thus, it\u2019s important to understand the limits on their power to force defendants to defend in a particular district as well. The constitutional limits on a state court\u2019s power to exercise jurisdiction are rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which provides, \u2018\u2018nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law\u2019\u2019 (emphasis supplied). The Fourteenth Amendment applies to the states; it does not apply to the federal government. The Fifth Amendment contains a similar due process clause that does apply to the federal government and its courts. However, it has been interpreted somewhat differently from the Fourteenth. Generally, the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause has been held to allow a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant if she has an appropriate relation to the United States as a whole, not to a particular state.

It also saves the plaintiff the trouble of drafting a new complaint, refiling it in the new district, and reserving the defendants with process. Here\u2019s an illustration.\n\nQuestion:\n7. A venue medley.

Pardee, who lives in Ohio, moves to dismiss the action for improper venue.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe court will have to dismiss, since 28 U.S.C. \u00a71406(a) only allows transfer to a district in which the case might have been brought.\n\nAnalysis:\nNibbling away at the edges, consider D, which takes the position that the Illinois federal judge can\u2019t transfer, since the case could not have been filed in the Western District of Kentucky. But it could have been. Because a significant part of the events giving rise to the claim\u2014the accident\u2014took place there, the Western District is a proper venue under \u00a71391(b)(2), and both defendants would be subject to personal jurisdiction in Kentucky based on minimum contacts. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nSo, when a plaintiff files suit in a district that is proper under the venue statute, the court may hear the case. However, it might also transfer it if the Gulf Oil factors suggest that it should be litigated in another federal district. But suppose a plaintiff files in a district that is not a proper venue under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71391? Naturally, the defendant may move to dismiss such a case for improper venue, under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3). And, the court would be within its rights to grant the motion. But could it transfer the case instead, to a federal district in which venue is proper? This is the scenario addressed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a71406(a). Section 1404(a) applies to cases in which the plaintiff chooses a proper venue and the court considers transferring the case elsewhere. Section 1406(a) applies when the plaintiff files in an improper venue and the court considers curing the problem by transfer. Section 1406(a) provides that, if the case is filed in an improper venue, the court \u2018\u2018shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\u2019\u2019 Note several things about the statute: first, it gives the federal district judge the authority to dismiss rather than transfer. Second, it allows the judge to transfer, even though the case is not properly before her (because venue is improper). And third, it limits the districts the case can be transferred to: It may only be moved to a district where it might have been brought. The cases interpret this limitation in \u00a71406(a) the same as the similar language in \u00a71404(a), that is, to limit transfer to a district that would be a proper venue and have personal jurisdiction over the defendants. A striking virtue of section 1406(a) is that it allows a court to save a plaintiff\u2019s cause of action if she files in the wrong venue shortly before the limitations period passes. Section 1404(a) would not authorize transfer: It applies to cases that are properly filed in the transferor district. But \u00a71406(a) allows the court to transfer the case to a proper district rather than dismissing. Thus, the suit is not re-started in the transferee forum, but continued. As long as it was filed in the wrong venue before the limitations period ran, the judge can send it to a district that is proper under the venue statute, and it will continue on, even though it only reached the proper court after the passage of the limitations period.

If it is, then \u00a71406(a) is irrelevant, and that eliminates three answers off the bat. Venue is not proper under \u00a71391(b). Section 1391(b)(2) is not satisfied, since no events giving rise to the claim took place in the Northern District of Illinois. And \u00a71391(b) (1) is not satisfied, since only one defendant resides in Illinois.

Laurel and Hardy are injured when they are traveling in Fields\u2019s car in the State of Emporia and Fields collides with Gleason. Laurel and Hardy bring a diversity action against Fields and Gleason in federal court. Under Emporia case law, it is unclear whether, if Gleason and Fields were both negligent, they would be liable for their percentages of fault (several liability) or each liable for the plaintiff\u2019s full damages (joint and several liability). The federal district judge, making her best guess at the law of Emporia on the liability of joint tortfeasors, concludes that the Emporia Supreme Court would apply joint and several liability. Consequently, after the jury finds both Fields and Gleason negligent, she holds each defendant liable for Laurel and Hardy\u2019s full damages, rather than for reduced damages based on each defendant\u2019s percentage of negligence. Fields appeals her ruling to the federal Court of Appeals. Gleason does not appeal. While Fields\u2019s appeal is pending, the Emporia Supreme Court holds, in an unrelated case, that several liability is the proper rule in joint tortfeasor cases. Fields\u2019s federal appeal is heard after the Emporia Supreme Court\u2019s decision comes down. Fields argues that the Court of Appeals should apply several liability to his case, even though the trial judge had applied joint and several liability. Gleason, the other defendant, moves for relief from the judgment against him in the federal district court, on the ground that the judgment was based on a mistake concerning the applicable law. The federal Court of Appeals will\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nreverse the decision in Fields\u2019s case, and remand it for entry of a new judgment based on several liability. The federal district court will grant Gleason\u2019s motion for relief from judgment.\n\nAnalysis:\nIn this example the federal judge did her best to ascertain the content of Emporia law. However, her prediction of Emporia law on joint and several liability turned out to be wrong. The Emporia Supreme Court has now made it clear that several liability is the law of Emporia. What should the federal diversity court now do about Laurel and Hardy\u2019s cases? There\u2019s an argument for A. The federal trial judge conscientiously performed her role under Erie: She made her best guess at the content of Emporia law, based on the precedents at the time, and applied it to the case. If Fields\u2019s appeal is decided under a \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 liability rule, it might have to be remanded for retrial, even though it was fairly tried under the law as the judge understood it at the time. This seems wasteful. On the other hand, by taking his appeal, Fields has challenged the trial judge\u2019s ruling that joint and several liability applies in Emporia. When the Court of Appeals reviews that ruling, shouldn\u2019t it consider all the data concerning the content of Emporia law? And what better data could there be on the point than this new decision from the Emporia Supreme Court? It seems artificial to uphold the trial judge\u2019s conclusion about Emporia law on the ground that it was reasonable at the time, when we now know that it was wrong. On this reasoning, the Court of Appeals will reverse the judgment against Fields and remand the case for entry of a new judgment based on several liability. The Court of Appeals, like the federal district court, must make its best guess at the content of Emporia law at the time it reviews the case, and it is now clear that several liability is the law of Emporia. Thus A is wrong. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nState law is not static.

Now that it is clear that Gleason\u2019s liability should be \u2018\u2018several\u2019\u2019 under Emporia law, shouldn\u2019t he get relief from the judgment, which was entered based on joint and several liability? There\u2019s an argument for Gleason\u2019s position, but it will very likely be rejected. Gleason\u2019s case is over. If he were allowed to challenge that judgment based on a later change\u2014or clarification\u2014of the law, judgments could be reopened whenever the law changed. This would place a large burden on the system, and undermine the finality of judgments. \u2018\u2018There is nothing in Erie that suggests that consistency must be achieved at the expense of finality, or that federal cases finally disposed of must be revisited any time an unrelated state case clarifies the applicable rules of law.\u2019\u2019 DeWeerth v. Baldinger, 38 F.3d 1266 (2d Cir. 1994). Fields\u2019s case is distinguishable, since he took an appeal, which was still pending at the time the state law changed. He had persisted in claiming that several liability applies and was still litigating the question in the original case when the Emporia court clarified its position. So, B is wrong. \n\nLabel:\n1", "Introduction:\nThe message of the Erie case is clear: \u2018\u2018federal court: apply state law in a diversity case.\u2019\u2019 But there was an interesting twist in Erie that the Supreme Court didn\u2019t discuss. Tompkins\u2019s accident took place in Pennsylvania, but he brought suit against the railroad in New York. Erie clearly requires the federal court to apply state law to his claim, but which state\u2019s law, Pennsylvania\u2019s\u2014where the accident happened\u2014or New York\u2019s, where the case was filed? Because the case has connections with both states, each would have a basis for applying its own law to it. How is the federal court to choose between the two bodies of state tort law? Every state has \u2018\u2018choice-of-law\u2019\u2019 rules to deal with this problem, which arises frequently in state cases as well as federal diversity cases. For example, for many years the states used the \u2018\u2018lex loci delicti\u2019\u2019 choice-of-law rule in tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of injury, even if the suit were filed in a different state. Similarly, in contracts cases, traditional choice-of-law doctrine looked to the contract law of the place where the contract was formed. After Erie established that federal diversity courts had to apply state law, federal courts faced the further problem of choosing which state\u2019s law to use in a case like Erie. Should federal courts develop their own \u2018\u2018choice-of-law\u2019\u2019 rules for diversity cases, or borrow from the states? Three years after Erie, the Supreme Court addressed this issue in Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941). Klaxon held that a federal diversity court should use the choice-of-law rules of the state in which it sits. Thus, a New York federal court should apply whatever state substantive law the New York state court would apply to the case. If a New York court, under its choice-of-law rules, would apply New York tort law to Tompkins\u2019s accident (even though it took place in Pennsylvania), the New York federal court should do so as well. On the other hand, if a New York court would, under its choice-of-law rule for torts, apply Pennsylvania law to Tompkins\u2019s case, the New York federal court should similarly look to Pennsylvania law. Klaxon reasoned that Erie required that the case come out the same way in federal court that it would in the state courts of the state where the federal court sat. To further that uniformity goal, the federal court should choose whatever body of tort law (or contract law or other state law) the local state court would. When Erie was decided, most courts applied the lex loci delicti choice of law rule to tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of the injury. Under the lex loci rule, there was little doubt that, if a New York state court heard Tompkins\u2019s case, it would apply Pennsylvania tort law to it. So a federal court in New York would also look to Pennsylvania tort law to decide the case. Today, however, states use widely divergent choice-of-law rules. One state might use the place-of-the-injury rule in a tort case, another might look to the interests of the various states connected to the case, and another state might apply its own law as long as the case has some connection to it. It is entirely possible, under this balkanized approach to choice of law, that a New York court would apply New York law to a case, even though, had the case been filed in Pennsylvania, that court would have chosen its law\u2014or that of a third state\u2014to govern the same case. Since New York courts and Pennsylvania courts might apply different bodies of tort law to a case, it follows, under Klaxon, that federal courts in those states might also end up applying different tort rules to the same dispute. If the New York federal court uses New York\u2019s choice of law rules to select the proper tort law (as it must under Klaxon), it might select New York law in a case like Tompkins\u2019s, because a New York state court would, under its choice-of-law rules. But, if Pennsylvania uses different choice of law rules, a Pennsylvania federal court using Pennsylvania choice of law rules might apply Pennsylvania law, if Tompkins sued there. So Tompkins\u2019s lawyers might find, even now, that by selecting a federal court in one state rather than another, they can still shop for more favorable law, since the federal court in each state will use local choice-of-law rules to select the applicable substantive law. The Klaxon Court recognized that its holding posed this risk, but shrugged it off as inevitable: Whatever lack of uniformity this may produce between federal courts in different states is attributable to our federal system, which leaves to a state, within the limits permitted by the Constitution, the right to pursue local policies diverging from those of its neighbors. 313 U.S. at 496. So, the bottom line is that a federal diversity court must apply whatever state law the courts of the state in which it sits would apply. In cases with connections to more than one state, this adds a second layer to the Erie analysis.\n\nQuestion:\n8. Your law or mine? Whitney, a Rhode Island citizen, goes skiing at a ski area in Vermont. When he purchases his lift ticket, he quickly signs a release of liability, waiving his right to sue, should he be injured due to negligence of the operator. While coming down an expert trail, he comes suddenly upon a bare spot full of rocks. He falls and is injured. He brings a diversity action against the operator in federal court in Rhode Island, basing personal jurisdiction on the fact that it had sent him an offer there for a weekend ski package that induced him to go to Vermont to ski. Assume that Rhode Island tort law refuses to enforce advance waivers of liability for negligence, unless they were individually negotiated. Assume further that Vermont tort law holds such waivers enforceable. Assume further that Rhode Island\u2019s choice-of-law rule for tort cases is to apply the law of the place of the injury, while Vermont\u2019s choice-of-law rule involves an assessment of the interests of the parties and states involved. It is less predictable under this balancing approach to choice of law whether the court would apply Rhode Island or Vermont law. The Rhode Island federal district judge would probably apply\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nVermont law to Whitney\u2019s case, because the accident happened in Vermont.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo A is the best answer. Although Rhode Island wouldn\u2019t enforce this waiver in a domestic case, its choice-of-law rule calls for application of the law of the place of injury, and that means Vermont law rather than its own. \n\nLabel:\n1", "Introduction:\nIn Hanna, the Court addressed the power of Congress to promulgate rules that govern procedure in the federal courts.

While this limitations period would not apply if it were a matter of federal judicial practice (see York), and probably could not be validly adopted as a Federal Rule (see 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b)), there\u2019s a strong argument, under Hanna\u2019s description of congressional power over procedure, that this statute could be enacted by Congress. After all, under Hanna, Congress has very broad authority to regulate procedure in the federal courts. You could imagine that Congress might seek to protect those courts from expending limited judicial resources on state claims by imposing a limitations period on diversity cases. It is very likely within its power to do so, and should be. Of course, it hasn\u2019t, and probably won\u2019t pass such a limitations statute, since such a statute would interfere significantly with the administration of state causes of action.

There\u2019s an argument for this, that it is a situation in which the basic constitutional command of Erie mandates adherence to state law. But a limitations period is not definitively \u2018\u2018substantive,\u2019\u2019 as a duty-to-a- trespasser rule would be, nor indisputably \u2018\u2018procedural.\u2019\u2019 Very likely, it falls \u2018\u2018within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, [where the rule is] rationally capable of classification as either.\u2019\u2019 Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. If so, this passage from Hanna suggests that the statute is valid, even though it preempts a state rule that has substantive as well as procedural purposes. Hanna\u2019s endorsement of congressional power to enact rules for the federal courts that have substantive ramifications suggests that such interference with state policy is permissible in this \u2018\u2018gray zone\u2019\u2019 between substance and procedure. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nAll of the questions in this chapter are hard. The York/Hanna doctrine is hard. So the Closer here is just another Closer. Consider again the two prongs of the Hanna analysis in choosing the best answer.  That is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer. But Hanna changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In Hanna, Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule. York and Byrd both involved such conflicts. York involved a conflict between a state statute and the judicial practice of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And Byrd involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal judicial practice of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these \u2018\u2018relatively unguided\u2019\u2019 Erie conflicts, Hanna reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in Byrd\u2019s language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because \u2018\u2018there can be no other law.\u2019\u2019 Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury\u2019s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy Erie sought to further\u2014uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts\u2014but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the Hanna opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of York\u2019s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are not prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and \u2018\u2018inequitable administration of the laws,\u2019\u2019 that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York line of cases would not require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following Question 1.) That\u2019s Hanna Part I. It\u2019s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in Hanna, unlike in York or in Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna construed Congress\u2019s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is \u2018\u2018rationally capable of classification\u2019\u2019 as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the \u2018\u2018outcome-determinative\u2019\u2019 test of York, or the more refined outcome-determinative test of Hanna Part I. But the rule involved in Hanna wasn\u2019t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to \u2018\u2018prescribe general rules of practice and procedure\u2019\u2019 for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a). In Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress\u2019s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted \u00a72072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that \u2018\u2018really regulates procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\u2019\u2019 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress\u2019s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress\u2019s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court\u2019s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b) provides that the Rules \u2018\u2018shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u2019\u2019 Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, \u00a72072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \u00a72072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and\u2014even if it is\u2014it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the \u2018\u2018modified outcome-determinative test\u2019\u2019 of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the \u2018\u2018Supreme Law of the Land.\u2019\u2019 United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under Hanna Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under Hanna Part II? \n\nQuestion:\n7. A matter of procedure? Columbus sues Moriarty in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Her claim is for an injury she suffered in Tennessee, when she was hit by a bullet fired by one of a group of hunters. Her injuries are grievous, so her damages evidence will be graphic and moving. There is a significant question in the case as to whether it was Moriarty who shot her. Moriarty moves to bifurcate the trial, that is, to try the issue of whether his bullet hit Columbus first\u2014and have the jury decide it\u2014before trying the damages issues. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) authorizes federal courts to order a separate trial of one or more issues \u2018\u2018in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice.\u2019\u2019 However, Tennessee has a state constitutional provision that has been interpreted to require a single, unified trial of all the issues in a suit. The federal judge grants the motion for a separate trial, and the jury finds that it was not Moriarty\u2019s bullet that hit Columbus. Judgment therefore enters for Moriarty. Columbus appeals, arguing that the court should have applied the state unified-trial approach. The Court of Appeals should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\naffirm the judgment, because Moriarty might have won in a unitary trial as well, so the Rule 42(b) decision to bifurcate is not outcome-determinative.\n\nAnalysis:\nA is wrong, because the use of federal procedure here doesn\u2019t turn on the outcome-determinative test.

Clear Code Software agreed to create a litigation-support computer program for Holmes, a lawyer. It contracted out the writing of the code to Jasper, a Caltech grad student. Jasper wrote the code using a computer he rented from High Tech Rentals, Inc. He delivered the code to Clear Code, which put the program together and delivered it to Holmes, who claimed that it never worked properly and didn\u2019t pay for it. Holmes sued Clear Code for breach of contract in federal court. (Assume that there are no subject matter jurisdiction problems with the action.) Clear Code in turn asserted a claim against Jasper, claiming that (while it was liable for Jasper\u2019s work) the problem resulted from his faulty programming, so that he should end up absorbing the loss. Jasper then asserted five claims. His first claim was a quantum meruit claim against Holmes for the value of the services he rendered in preparing the computer program. The second was a claim for defamation against Holmes, for claiming to Clear Code that his programming work was \u2018\u2018abominable.\u2019\u2019 His third claim was against High Tech, claiming that a glitch in the computer they rented to him caused the problem in the code, causing the Holmes program to fail. Jasper alleged that, if he was liable to Clear Code, then High Tech, as the cause of the defect in the program, should end up absorbing the damages. Fourth, he asserted a claim against Clear Code, the defendant, for the fee he had been promised for preparing the Holmes code, and another for his fee for an unrelated job.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nOf Jasper\u2019s two claims against Clear Code only the one for the Holmes job is proper under the rules.\n\nAnalysis:\nB asserts that Jasper\u2019s first claim against Clear Code, for the contract price for the job, is a proper claim, but that his other claim, for the fee on an unrelated job, is improper. This isn\u2019t right. Both claims are counterclaims, the first, compulsory, the second, permissive. Rule 13(a) (1) requires Jasper to assert claims he has against an opposing party (here, the defendant/third-party plaintiff, Clear Code) if they arise from the same events as the main claim. The claim for Jasper\u2019s fee clearly does, so it is a compulsory counterclaim. His claim for his fee on another job is a permissive counterclaim under Rule 13(b) (though it might also be characterized as an added claim under Rule 18(a)). There could be jurisdictional problems with it, but there\u2019s none under the joinder rules.

Jasper\u2019s claim for the value of his work on the code arises from the same events as the main claim. His other claim, for defamation based on Holmes\u2019s complaints about his work, is less clear, though it arguably could be held to arise from the same events. It\u2019s close; it doesn\u2019t arise directly from the contract, but from Holmes\u2019s reaction to the quality of the contract work. But we don\u2019t have to decide whether it arises from the same transaction or occurrence or not. Even if both do, Jasper doesn\u2019t have to assert them in this action. Rule 14(a)(2)(D) allows, but does not require a third-party defendant to assert claims he has against the plaintiff, even if they do arise from the same events.

Jasper asserted two claims against the plaintiff, two back against Clear Code, and one against High Tech, which, until then, was not a party to the action. D suggests that Jasper can\u2019t assert this claim against High Tech, because only an original defendant can implead a party. However, Rule 14(a)(5) authorizes a third-party defendant to implead another party (called a fourth-party defendant) who may be liable to him for all or part of the defendant\u2019s claim against him. Again, the rule restricts the right to implead to derivative liability situations, but that\u2019s what Jasper has alleged: that if he is held liable because the code was defective, he can pass on the liability to High Tech. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \u00a71367(a) is broad; indeed, it probably reaches to the outer limit of constitutional power to hear added claims, as defined in Gibbs. However, after granting supplemental jurisdiction very broadly in \u00a71367(a), Congress pulled back a bit in \u00a71367(b), which bars jurisdiction\u2014even if the test in \u00a71367(a) is satisfied\u2014over certain claims in diversity cases. Thus, the best way to analyze a \u00a71367 problem is to ask first, whether the added claim comes within the broad grant in \u00a71367(a). If it does, then ask whether it is one of the narrow set of claims that \u00a71367(b) excepts from supplemental jurisdiction. Section 1367(b) was drafted with Kroger in mind. Kroger had suggested that the federal courts shouldn\u2019t always exercise jurisdiction over related claims to the full extent of the power delineated in Gibbs. Kroger held that the federal courts should not hear claims by plaintiffs against third-party defendants in diversity cases, even if they arose out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the main claim, if doing so would be inconsistent with the long-standing complete diversity rule of Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. 267 (1806). In 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(b), Congress sought to preserve the Kroger limit on supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases. Section 1367(b). In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332. This provision is the source of most student confusion concerning supplemental jurisdiction. Basically, it provides that in diversity cases only, the federal court will not have supplemental jurisdiction over certain claims by plaintiffs or persons sought to be joined as plaintiffs. Not all claims, just some claims, defined in \u00a71367(b) by reference to the rules used to join them. The purpose for this exception to the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \u00a71367(a) is to prevent parties from evading the Strawbridge complete diversity rule. Under that rule, a plaintiff in a diversity case can\u2019t sue defendants from her own state. If she could achieve the same result by suing a diverse defendant and then using supplemental jurisdiction to add a claim against one who is not diverse, Strawbridge would be a dead letter. Some think it should be a dead letter, but Congress evidently doesn\u2019t. So \u00a71367(b) enumerates certain situations in which a plaintiff in a diversity case cannot rely on supplemental jurisdiction to assert additional claims, even if they arise out of the same case or controversy under \u00a71367(a). Section 1367(b) isn\u2019t too bad if you approach it in steps. \u2022 First, ask if jurisdiction over the main claim is based solely on diversity. If it isn\u2019t, stop! Section 1367(b) does not apply, because the first phrase in the subsection says \u2018\u2018in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332. . . .\u2019\u2019 \u2022 Next, if jurisdiction over the original case is based solely on diversity, ask if the claim you are analyzing was asserted by a plaintiff. If it isn\u2019t, stop! Section 1367(b) does not apply, because it only excepts certain \u2018\u2018claims by plaintiffs\u2019\u2019 (or persons being joined as plaintiffs under Rules 19 or 24). And the word \u2018\u2018plaintiff\u2019\u2019 means the original plaintiff, not a third-party plaintiff or a \u2018\u2018plaintiff\u2019\u2019 on a counterclaim. \u2022 Then, if the case is based on diversity, and the added claim is asserted by a plaintiff, you have to ask if it is a claim \u2018\u2018against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24\u2019\u2019 of the Federal Rules. If so, supplemental jurisdiction is barred. \u2022 Or, if the case involves Rule 19 or Rule 24, consider whether the person would be joined as a plaintiff under Rule 19 or intervene as a plaintiff under Rule 24. If so, \u00a71367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. \u2022 Last, just to be thorough, ask whether there is a basis for original jurisdiction over the added claim. If there is, the claim should be fine even though it is one of the claims described in \u00a71367(b). If the claim could have been asserted in federal court on its own, there is no need for supplemental jurisdiction. For example, if Luis, a plaintiff from Maine, asserts a claim against DeVoto (a third-party defendant in the case who is also from Maine) under a federal statute, who cares that there\u2019s no diversity, and who cares that \u00a71367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. This is a case that Luis could have asserted in federal court in a stand-alone suit, so the court has jurisdiction over it without regard to supplemental jurisdiction. An example should help. In analyzing it, ask first whether the federal court has original jurisdiction based on a proper federal court claim, then whether the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \u00a71367(a) applies, and then whether \u00a71367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction over it.\n\nQuestion:\n6.

After Newcomb is brought in under Rule 14(a), Cavers asserts a claim directly against Newcomb, alleging tortious interference with the contract, a state law claim, against him and seeking the same damages.

For the court to hear the claim, it must be within the constitutional grant of jurisdiction over related claims, expounded in Gibbs, and Congress must convey that jurisdiction to the federal district courts by statute. Both Kroger and Finley reminded us of that. For statutory authorization, we look to \u00a71367.

But is it barred by the \u00a71367(b) exceptions? No, it isn\u2019t, because this is not a diversity case. Section 1367(b) limits certain claims by plaintiffs in diversity cases.

This is so, even though Cavers and Pariah (the original parties to the case) are diverse.

Suppose that Currier and Ives were injured in an accident, and sued Hochstein. If Currier\u2019s damages were $120,000, and Ives\u2019s were $25,000, Currier would satisfy the amount in controversy requirement in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a)(1), but Ives would not. Ives could not add his damages together with Currier\u2019s, and argue the case was for $145,000: he had to assert a claim himself for more than $75,000. Similarly, if a plaintiff sued multiple defendants, she had to assert a colorable claim for more than $75,000 against each defendant. Suppose Currier sued Hochstein for $60,000 in business losses, and claimed that he was entitled to double damages under an unfair business practices statute. He might recover a total of $120,000 on these claims, so he met the amount requirement. Now suppose that Currier made Faust a second defendant, seeking recovery of the same business losses, but the double damages statute did not apply to Faust. Because Currier only had a $60,000 claim against Faust, he did not satisfy the amount requirement against her. Again, he had to meet the amount in controversy requirement separately against each defendant. When Congress enacted the supplemental jurisdiction statute, it probably did not intend to change either of those rules. However, the text of \u00a71367 appears to change one of them. The question below illustrates the problem, which the Supreme Court addressed at length in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, 545 U.S. 546 (2005). In analyzing the problem, focus ruthlessly on the language of the statute.\n\nQuestion:\n8. Supplementing supplemental jurisdiction. Cavers, from Wisconsin, sues Pariah Corporation, an Iowa corporation with its principal place of business in Iowa, for damages for breach of contract, after he is fired by Pariah on the ground that he, along with Westford, had embezzled funds from Pariah. Cavers sues in federal court, for $100,000, based on diversity jurisdiction. Westford, another Wisconsin citizen, was also fired for the embezzlement, and joins as a coplaintiff in the suit, seeking $40,000 in damages. Under the language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367 in the suit, the court would\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nhave jurisdiction over Westford\u2019s claim under \u00a71367(a), but it is barred by \u00a71367(b).\n\nAnalysis:\nA is also off the mark. It states that \u00a71367(a) authorizes supplemental jurisdiction, but that \u00a71367(b) takes it away. But none of the exceptions in \u00a71367(b) expressly applies. Westford\u2019s claim is a \u2018\u2018claim by [a] plaintiff,\u2019\u2019 but it is not \u2018\u2018against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24.\u2019\u2019 Rule 20 would apply if there were multiple defendants, since it applies to claims against parties joined under Rule 20. But it doesn\u2019t seem to apply where there is only one defendant. So none of the exceptions in \u00a71367(b) bars this claim, on a plain reading of the statute. If Congress meant to perpetuate the rule that each plaintiff must meet the amount in controversy requirement separately, it could have included an exception in \u00a71367(b) for \u2018\u2018claims by plaintiffs joined under Rule 20 that do not meet the amount in controversy requirement,\u2019\u2019 or similar language. It didn\u2019t. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nRule 8 contains simple, sensible provisions governing the defendant\u2019s responses to the allegations in the complaint. First, Rule 8(b) requires the defendant to admit or deny each of the allegations in the complaint. Usually, this is done paragraph by paragraph. Rule 10(b) requires that averments in the complaint be set forth in separate paragraphs. The defendant, in answering, must take a position on each of these allegations, by admitting those that are true, and denying those that aren\u2019t. Under Rule 8(b)(2), a \u2018\u2018denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.\u2019\u2019 If the defendant means to deny only a part of an allegation, she must specify what is true and deny only the parts that are not. Failing to deny an allegation constitutes an admission of it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6). The idea is that, if the parties plead conscientiously by the Rules, the parties and the court can compare the allegations in the complaint and the responses in the answer, and determine which issues are contested and which are agreed upon (and therefore need not be litigated). If all goes right, this simple pleading process can narrow the scope of the dispute considerably. The Rule also recognizes that the defendant may not know whether some allegations in the complaint are true or not. If she has grounds to deny them, she may do so, but if she just doesn\u2019t know, or doesn\u2019t have the information necessary to admit or deny at the time of pleading, she may respond that she \u2018\u2018lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(5). Under the rule, this response to an allegation \u2018\u2018has the effect of a denial.\u2019\u2019 To determine what issues remain in dispute, of course, the plaintiff\u2014 and the court\u2014have to read the defendant\u2019s answer in light of the provisions of the pleading rules. Consider, for example, what the plaintiff should make of the defendant\u2019s answer in the following case.\n\nQuestion:\n8. Yes, no, and maybe. Patterson sues Applied Electronics, Inc., for injuries suffered in an accident with Adair, one of AE\u2019s delivery drivers. Patterson alleges in Paragraph 4 of his complaint that Adair was an employee of AE at the time of the accident, that Adair was acting in the scope of employment at the time of the accident (which Patterson must prove in order to recover from the employer), that Adair was talking on his cell phone at the time of the accident, and that Adair\u2019s negligent driving caused the accident. AE answers Paragraph 4 as follows: \u2018\u2018The defendant admits that Adair was its employee at the time of the accident, denies that Adair was negligent, but is without sufficient information to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation that Adair was talking on his cell phone at the time of the accident.\u2019\u2019 Under Federal Rule 8,\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nAE has admitted that Adair was its employee, but not that he acted in the scope of employment. The allegation that Adair was talking on his cell phone is treated as denied.\n\nAnalysis:\nThis question simply requires you to compare Patterson\u2019s allegations with the defendant\u2019s responses, and apply the provisions of Rule 8 as to the effect of a denial, failure to deny, or allegation that the pleader is \u2018\u2018without sufficient facts to form a belief.\u2019\u2019 (Remember, my questions assume that you have the Rule in front of you. I\u2019m not testing whether you remember the provisions of the rule, though your professor might. Rather, the questions test whether you can apply the rules to these allegations and responses.) Naturally, AE has admitted that Adair was its employee, by admitting it! (Sometimes even the pleading rules are commonsensical.) The allegation that Adair was talking on his cell phone is treated as denied: Under the Rule 8(b)(5), the \u2018\u2018without sufficient information\u2019\u2019 response is treated as a denial. Adair hasn\u2019t responded at all to the allegation that Adair acted in the scope of employment at the time of the accident. Frequently, defendants would like to ignore allegations in the complaint, if they aren\u2019t sure of their truth, or it would be awkward to admit them. But this head-in-the-sand strategy doesn\u2019t work under the Rules: Rule 8(b)(6) provides that allegations that are not denied are deemed admitted. So, effectively, AE has admitted that Adair was its employee and that he acted in the scope of employment, but denied negligence and that Adair was chatting on the cell phone. So, B is right.\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nAs we saw in the first part of this chapter, the Federal Rules allow the plaintiff to present as many claims as she has evidence to support, even if they can\u2019t all be true. The idea is to put the defendant on notice of the positions that you may seek to establish, not a single one you have settled on irrevocably. The same goes for the defendant. Under Rule 8, the defendant is allowed to plead whatever defenses she has to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. She may take inconsistent positions about the facts or the law, and may raise multiple defenses without choosing among them. The defendant might, for example, deny that she was negligent, but also allege that the plaintiff was more negligent than she was and is therefore barred from recovery. She might deny that she had a contract with the plaintiff, raise as a second defense that she did not breach, and raise as a third defense that the statute of limitations bars recovery. Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn\u2019t required to stake her case on one of them. Although Rule 11(b)(3) requires support for affirmative defenses as well as factual allegations in the original complaint, it is unfortunately common for defendants to \u2018\u2018overplead\u2019\u2019 affirmative defenses. Given the short period for filing an answer, and the potential for malpractice exposure for failing to raise a defense, many answers include a long list of \u2018\u2018boilerplate\u2019\u2019 defenses, many clearly irrelevant to the case. Doubtless, counsel view the risk of sanctions for overpleading defenses as less grievous than the risk of waiving a defense by failing to assert it.

When it answers the complaint, AE has some information suggesting that Adair was acting in the scope of employment at the time, but also some information suggesting that he was not.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nAE should admit and deny that Adair acted in the scope of employment at the time of the accident, since it has some information that would support both positions.\n\nAnalysis:\nA is an interesting suggestion. The rules expressly allow the parties to take different positions\u2014where they don\u2019t know the true facts\u2014 \u2018\u2018regardless of consistency.\u2019\u2019 So, if you have some evidence suggesting that the allegation is true, and some suggesting that it is false, why not admit and deny? It\u2019s hard to plead more honestly than that! Of course, the defendant presumably does not want to admit that Adair acted in the scope of employment. So the fact that it would be permissible to take inconsistent positions isn\u2019t the end of the matter . . . must the defendant do so? Certainly not. A pleader decides what defenses she wishes to raise, from those permissible under the rules. Because AE has evidentiary support for the position that Adair did not act in the scope of his employment, a denial is proper. AE has grounds to admit it too, since they have some evidence of that as well, but clearly doesn\u2019t want to raise that as a \u2018\u2018defense\u2019\u2019 and isn\u2019t required to. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nAs we saw in the first part of this chapter, the Federal Rules allow the plaintiff to present as many claims as she has evidence to support, even if they can\u2019t all be true.

Basically, this response keeps the defendant\u2019s options open to develop evidence that Adair was not in the scope of employment, without having to explicitly take that position in the answer before it has fully developed its case.

AE has not admitted the allegation, and may still try to disprove the scope-of-employment allegation. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThere are some subtle problems in the amendment area. So we have a pre-closer and a closer. A party who sues a defendant on a claim within the limitations period may change theories, add new damages, or recast the factual basis of the claim through amendments, assuming that the amended allegations still are based on the same underlying facts, and that the judge allows the amendment. The amended allegations will \u2018\u2018relate back\u2019\u2019 to the date the original complaint was filed. If the claim asserted in the amended complaint would have been timely on that date, Rule 15(c)(1)(B) avoids any limitations problem. But suppose the amendment adds a new defendant to the case? Rule 15 has a separate, more abstruse provision, Rule 15(c)(1)(C), that deals with this twist. As an example, assume that Leroy sues Tele-Sell, a telemarketing firm, under a statute barring telemarketing calls to consumers who have placed their names on a state do-not-call list. After he sues, the limitations period passes. Several months later, he learns that he was mistaken, that the calls actually came from Tel-Connect, a different firm. Consequently, he moves to amend to substitute Tel- Connect as the defendant. Allowing relation back for an amendment like this, adding a new party, requires a more stringent standard than others, because the new claim is against a different defendant, who was not sued before the limitations period expired. Under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) three requirements must be met before an amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted will \u2018\u2018relate back\u2019\u2019 to the date the original complaint was filed. \u2022 First, the amended pleading must arise out of the same events as the original pleading. Rule 15(c)(1)(C). \u2022 Second, the defendant being added must have \u2018\u2018received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). This notice must have been received within the period of time it would have been received had the new defendant been sued originally. \u2022 Third, the plaintiff must show that the new defendant brought in by the amendment \u2018\u2018knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The first requirement is met in Leroy\u2019s case. He is suing Tel-Connect for the same harassing calls that were the basis of his initial suit against Tele-Sell. But Rule 15(c)(1) requires more than that. It also requires that Tel-Connect was aware, within the period for suing and serving the complaint on Tele-Sell, that the suit had been brought, and that it\u2014Tel- Connect\u2014was actually the intended target of the suit. What\u2019s the point of this complex provision? It is meant to ensure that Tel-Connect, the party Leroy brings in late, had actual notice within the limitations period (plus the additional 90 days that Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) gives for serving the complaint2) that Leroy intended to sue it. If it had such notice, the purpose of the limitations period has been satisfied: The added defendant was aware of the need to preserve evidence and prepare a defense, within the limitations period prescribed by the legislature. Perhaps the following question will help to sort out the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C).\n\nQuestion:\n7. Black and White. Williams is roughed up during an arrest by a police officer and suffers a broken wrist that doesn\u2019t heal right. Williams consults Darrow, a lawyer, who brings a federal civil rights action for his injury. Darrow obtains the police report of the arrest, which lists Officer Black as the arresting officer. Darrow names Black as the defendant. Suit is filed one month before the limitations period runs. In fact, it wasn\u2019t Black who arrested Williams, it was Officer White. The report, filled out by the booking officer, was simply mistaken. Within a few days, every officer in the precinct, including White, became aware that Black had been sued by an arrestee for excessive force, though they were not aware of the specific circumstances of the case or the identity of the plaintiff. Six months later, Black answers interrogatories sent to him by Williams, denying that he was the arresting officer. Darrow investigates, confirms from other witnesses that White was the arresting officer, and moves to amend to name White as the defendant in the action. The amendment, if allowed, will likely\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nnot relate back, because it was filed after the limitations period had passed and White was not on notice that he was the intended target of Williams\u2019s suit.\n\nAnalysis:\nB is the better answer. While the amendment could relate back, it doesn\u2019t here, because White was not on notice that the action should have been filed against him. He knew that Black had been sued, but the question does not indicate that he understood that the suit was by Williams, or that it was for an arrest White had made. Thus, he is unaware, as Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) requires, that, \u2018\u2018but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity,\u2019\u2019 the action would have been brought against him. This is a nice example of the difference between the \u2018\u2018best\u2019\u2019 answer and the \u2018\u2018right\u2019\u2019 answer. A is arguably right\u2014the amendment will not relate back\u2014but B is tighter, more precise in reflecting the logic for that result.

Under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) three requirements must be met before an amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted will \u2018\u2018relate back\u2019\u2019 to the date the original complaint was filed. \u2022 First, the amended pleading must arise out of the same events as the original pleading. Rule 15(c)(1)(C). \u2022 Second, the defendant being added must have \u2018\u2018received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). This notice must have been received within the period of time it would have been received had the new defendant been sued originally. \u2022 Third, the plaintiff must show that the new defendant brought in by the amendment \u2018\u2018knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The first requirement is met in Leroy\u2019s case. He is suing Tel-Connect for the same harassing calls that were the basis of his initial suit against Tele-Sell. But Rule 15(c)(1) requires more than that. It also requires that Tel-Connect was aware, within the period for suing and serving the complaint on Tele-Sell, that the suit had been brought, and that it\u2014Tel- Connect\u2014was actually the intended target of the suit. What\u2019s the point of this complex provision? It is meant to ensure that Tel-Connect, the party Leroy brings in late, had actual notice within the limitations period (plus the additional 90 days that Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) gives for serving the complaint2) that Leroy intended to sue it. If it had such notice, the purpose of the limitations period has been satisfied: The added defendant was aware of the need to preserve evidence and prepare a defense, within the limitations period prescribed by the legislature. Perhaps the following question will help to sort out the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C).\n\nQuestion:\n7. Black and White. Williams is roughed up during an arrest by a police officer and suffers a broken wrist that doesn\u2019t heal right. Williams consults Darrow, a lawyer, who brings a federal civil rights action for his injury. Darrow obtains the police report of the arrest, which lists Officer Black as the arresting officer. Darrow names Black as the defendant. Suit is filed one month before the limitations period runs. In fact, it wasn\u2019t Black who arrested Williams, it was Officer White. The report, filled out by the booking officer, was simply mistaken. Within a few days, every officer in the precinct, including White, became aware that Black had been sued by an arrestee for excessive force, though they were not aware of the specific circumstances of the case or the identity of the plaintiff. Six months later, Black answers interrogatories sent to him by Williams, denying that he was the arresting officer. Darrow investigates, confirms from other witnesses that White was the arresting officer, and moves to amend to name White as the defendant in the action. The amendment, if allowed, will likely\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nrelate back, because White was aware, before the passage of the limitations period, that Black had been sued.\n\nAnalysis:\nC suggests that the amendment to add White will relate back, because White knew, within the limitations period for Williams\u2019s claim, that Black had been sued. But that isn\u2019t enough under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) either. The rule requires that White receive, within the limitation period (plus the 90 days for service of the complaint), \u2018\u2018such notice of the action that [White] will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits. . . .\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). Knowledge that someone has sued Black for excessive force is hardly the equivalent of notice that Williams had mistakenly sued Black for the arrest made by White. The question indicates that other officers were not aware of the particular circumstances, so it is unlikely that White was on notice that Black had been sued for an arrest he (White) had made. Unless Williams could show that it would be clear to White that the suit must be for his arrest of Williams, so that, \u2018\u2018but for a mistake concerning the identity of the proper party\u2019\u2019 he would have been the defendant, White doesn\u2019t have the notice called for by Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThere are some subtle problems in the amendment area. So we have a pre-closer and a closer. A party who sues a defendant on a claim within the limitations period may change theories, add new damages, or recast the factual basis of the claim through amendments, assuming that the amended allegations still are based on the same underlying facts, and that the judge allows the amendment. The amended allegations will \u2018\u2018relate back\u2019\u2019 to the date the original complaint was filed. If the claim asserted in the amended complaint would have been timely on that date, Rule 15(c)(1)(B) avoids any limitations problem. But suppose the amendment adds a new defendant to the case? Rule 15 has a separate, more abstruse provision, Rule 15(c)(1)(C), that deals with this twist. As an example, assume that Leroy sues Tele-Sell, a telemarketing firm, under a statute barring telemarketing calls to consumers who have placed their names on a state do-not-call list. After he sues, the limitations period passes. Several months later, he learns that he was mistaken, that the calls actually came from Tel-Connect, a different firm. Consequently, he moves to amend to substitute Tel- Connect as the defendant. Allowing relation back for an amendment like this, adding a new party, requires a more stringent standard than others, because the new claim is against a different defendant, who was not sued before the limitations period expired. Under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) three requirements must be met before an amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted will \u2018\u2018relate back\u2019\u2019 to the date the original complaint was filed. \u2022 First, the amended pleading must arise out of the same events as the original pleading.

This notice must have been received within the period of time it would have been received had the new defendant been sued originally. \u2022 Third, the plaintiff must show that the new defendant brought in by the amendment \u2018\u2018knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The first requirement is met in Leroy\u2019s case. He is suing Tel-Connect for the same harassing calls that were the basis of his initial suit against Tele-Sell.

The amendment, if allowed, will likely\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nrelate back, because it arises out of the same arrest alleged in the initial complaint.\n\nAnalysis:\nD takes the position that the amended complaint will relate back, since it arises from the same arrest. This is wrong, because Rule 15(c)(1) (C) provides that the amendment will only relate back if that is true and the two further requirements in Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i) and 15(c)(1)(C)(ii) are met. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nRule 11(c)(2) is often referred to as the \u2018\u2018safe harbor\u2019\u2019 provision of Rule 11. This subsection is intended to limit court time spent on sanctions motions while at the same time providing an incentive to clean up dubious pleadings and other filings. Under Rule 11(c)(2) a party who concludes that allegations in an opponent\u2019s filing are sanctionable may draft a motion for sanctions, citing the offending allegations. However, the moving party does not file the motion with the court; she sends it (presumably, with a supporting memorandum explaining why the challenged allegations are sanctionable) to the offending party. The rule gives the offender 21 days to withdraw or correct the challenged items. If she does, that\u2019s the end of it; the offender has sailed into the safe harbor; the moving party will not file the motion and the court will not impose a sanction. If the offender does not correct or withdraw, then the party who sent the motion files it with the court, which will hear the motion and may not only impose a sanction for submitting the unsupported paper, but may also award the moving party expenses and fees for the motion. The logic of Rule 11(c)(2) is impeccable: Put the party on notice of the unwarranted allegations, let her clean it up or withdraw it, and get on with the real issues in the case without taking the court\u2019s time culling out the frivolous ones. One wonders, however, if the practice matches the theory. How often will a litigator, who after all drafted and submitted the paper, roll over and cry \u2018\u2018mea culpa!\u2019\u2019 when an unloved opponent brands her a rule breaker? It may be that many litigators, who tend to be a feisty lot, will succumb to the temptation to dig in their heels rather than recognize the error of their ways. This would be unfortunate, but one suspects that the aggressive litigator does not always resemble Judge Hand\u2019s Reasonable Person. Here\u2019s an interesting question on the point.\n\nQuestion:\n6. The unsafe harbor. Withers sues Rendoso in federal court in East Dakota for negligent indirect infliction of emotional distress, claiming that he suffered severe distress from witnessing an accident in which a friend was seriously injured. Rendoso moves to dismiss the claim under Rule 12(b) (6) for failure to state a claim, citing two recent cases from the East Dakota Supreme Court that quite clearly limit the right to recover for indirect infliction to close family members. The court enters an order dismissing the claim. Rendoso now moves for sanctions under Rule 11(b)(2), on the ground that the legal position taken in Withers\u2019s complaint was frivolous. The court will likely\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ndeny the motion, because the court can only impose sanctions if the paper was challenged under the Rule 11(c)(2) procedure.\n\nAnalysis:\nD is contradicted by Rule 11(c)(3), which clearly allows a federal judge to initiate sanctions on his or her own, even though no party has moved for sanctions. Surely this is appropriate. Frivolous papers are an affront to the court and a waste of its time as well as that of the parties. The court has the power to sanction them whether a party has requested it to do so or not. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThere\u2019s a lot more to Rule 11 than we have covered so far. Let\u2019s round out the discussion with a Closer that\u2014if you want to nail it\u2014will force you do something many of my students resist to the teeth\u2014to actually read the rule. The answers to this Closer are all tucked in there somewhere. Think of it as a litigator\u2019s treasure hunt.  The previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments. They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important question: What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).)  Consider the dilemma for the drafters of Rule 11 when establishing ethical limits on asserting legal positions before the court. Surely, they don\u2019t want to prevent lawyers from arguing for legal positions that have not been recognized before. Then the law could never change, because lawyers would be subject to sanctions for arguing for change. Surely, the rule makers also would not want to bar lawyers from arguing for the overruling of established law, for the same reason. But they do want to rein in extravagant or outlandish legal arguments that waste the courts\u2019 time. Rule 11(b) walks this line by requiring that there be a \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous argument\u2019\u2019 for legal positions that are not currently recognized or would require the court to overrule current law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), an advocate certifies to the court that the legal positions taken in a pleading, motion or other paper are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), the party asserting a legal position must have a rational argument for the position asserted, a position that has not been definitively rejected by the courts of the jurisdiction so recently that nothing but obstinacy would lead a lawyer to try again. Such \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous\u2019\u2019 arguments might be based on precedents from other states, dissenting opinions, changes by the appellate courts of the relevant state in related areas of law, scholarly criticism of the current law, or other authority suggesting that change is warranted. If you are going to file a pleading, motion, or other paper that argues for a change in the law, but don\u2019t want to risk Rule 11 sanctions, think of it this way: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going out on a limb here. My position is contradicted by the cases. If the judge calls me in before the bench and asks why I should not be sanctioned for violating Rule 11(b)(2), what will I say?\u2019\u2019 You need to be ready with a credible explanation why your argument for change is justified by precedent or other authority. You might say, \u2018\u2018Yes, your honor, I know that I\u2019m arguing to overrule Flores v. Jones, the case on point from our state supreme court, but the Third Restatement of Torts now takes the position I advocate, and four states have recently adopted it.\u2019\u2019 Or, \u2018\u2018Yes, your Honor, I know our state supreme court ruled otherwise in 1934, but look at how many areas of tort law they have modified since. Recognizing this cause of action is supported by our court\u2019s consistent expansion of tort remedies for negligence, reflected in the following seven cases.\u2019\u2019 Arguments like those are \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous.\u2019\u2019 The advocate is not just saying, \u2018\u2018I think the law should be otherwise,\u2019\u2019 but pointing to legal authority that supports the argument. This is reasoned persuasive argument rather than stubborn refusal to face the music. Courts should not prevent that, and Rule 11(b) (2) does not either. Consider this question on the point.  Rule 11 also imposes constraints on the factual allegations made in a pleading or motion. Under Rule 11(b)(3), the party making factual allegations certifies that \u2018\u2018after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,\u2019\u2019 those allegations \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\u2019\u2019 The basic standard, that the factual contentions \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support,\u2019\u2019 mandates that counsel have looked into the facts and have credible evidence in support of each fact alleged in her court filings. This standard clearly does not require that the evidence available at the time of filing the paper clearly establishes the fact alleged, or even makes it more probable than not that the fact is true. It requires that counsel have looked into the matter, and after doing so has some preliminary evidence in support of the allegation. That\u2019s a pretty indulgent standard, yet it does bar the tempting practice of filing papers without evidence and then casting about to find some later down the line. That is a temptation to busy counsel that Rule 11(b)(3) is meant to discourage. Consider this example. To nail it, take a look at Rule 11(c)(1) as well as Rule 11(b). \n\nQuestion:\n7. Fudd-ging Rule 11. Which of the following orders of Judge Fudd would be authorized by Rule 11?\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nNorris, lawyer for the plaintiff Conowitz, files a complaint seeking recovery on behalf of Conowitz for indirect infliction of emotional distress Conowitz suffered from witnessing injury to a stranger. Norris alleges in the complaint that the law allows recovery for this. However, a recent decision from the state\u2019s highest court clearly bars recovery for indirect infliction unless the direct victim of the accident was a family member. Judge Fudd imposes a monetary sanction on Conowitz for the filing.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet\u2019s work through them in order. A is not authorized by Rule 11: His Honor has sanctioned the client for a legal position asserted by her counsel. Rule 11(c)(5)(A) bars this. The logic for this is not far to seek. It is the lawyers who determine what legal positions to assert in a pleading; the clients know little or nothing about it and rely on counsel to do this. Consequently, it is the lawyers who take the risk of sanctions for asserting frivolous legal claims. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThere\u2019s a lot more to Rule 11 than we have covered so far.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). That\u2019s understandable. In studying personal jurisdiction, we read common law cases in which the defendant \u2018\u2018appears specially\u2019\u2019 to object to jurisdiction. Then we study pleadings and motions under the Federal Rules, and along comes a different approach to jurisdictional objections. It\u2019s easy enough to mix them up. The special appearance was the common law\u2019s rather formalistic approach to raising objections to personal jurisdiction. A defendant who claimed that the court in which suit was filed lacked jurisdiction over her would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 to contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The defendant making a special appearance had to do so before answering the complaint on the merits, and she had to confine her argument to the lack of jurisdiction. If she raised any other issue, the court would hold that she had entered a \u2018\u2018general appearance\u2019\u2019 by litigating issues other than jurisdiction. Any reference to the merits, or even to other types of preliminary objections, could lead the court to conclude that, by appearing to litigate other issues, the defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and waived her objection to personal jurisdiction. In the federal courts, and in the many states that have modeled their procedural rules after the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, objections to personal jurisdiction are governed by Rule 12. The common law special appearance does not apply. But Rule 12 bears some resemblance to its common law ancestor. It still requires that the objection be asserted in the first response to the complaint, either a pre-answer motion or answer. And it still provides that the objection is waived if it isn\u2019t raised in a timely manner. The major difference, however, is that a defendant who moves to dismiss in federal court under Rule 12 for lack of jurisdiction may, in the same motion, assert other pre-answer defenses. She could, for example, move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to join an indispensable party. If she raised those two objections in a jurisdiction that adheres to the older special appearance approach, she would be deemed to waive her objection to personal jurisdiction by also raising an issue that is presumably only relevant if the court has jurisdiction. Here are two examples to help sort these matters out. They both involve cases removed to federal court. Keep in mind that in a removed case, state procedure applies until removal. Federal procedure applies once the case has been removed to federal court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c)(1).\n\nQuestion:\n8. Something special. Goloupolos sues Hue in state court, in a state that uses the special appearance approach to objections to personal jurisdiction. Hue responds by filing an objection in the state court to personal jurisdiction, and a motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. Five days later, before the court rules on his objections, he removes the action to federal court. After removal, he moves to dismiss, on the ground that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him. Goloupolos argues that the defense has been waived. The court will probably rule that Hue has\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nwaived the objection to personal jurisdiction, because he invoked the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction by removing the case.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet\u2019s deal first with a major source of confusion illustrated by A. A defendant does not waive objections to personal jurisdiction by removing a case to federal court. When sued in a state court, the defendant has only thirty days to remove. He can\u2019t wait for the state court to rule on an objection to personal jurisdiction, and then remove if he loses on it. He has to remove right away, before the issue is likely to be decided by the state court. Suppose the defendant reasons as follows: \u2018\u2018I think the Utah court lacks personal jurisdiction over me for this claim. I\u2019d like to get the case dismissed on that ground. But if the court doesn\u2019t agree that it lacks jurisdiction, I\u2019d rather litigate this case in federal court.\u2019\u2019 If this is the defendant\u2019s thinking, he has to remove, doesn\u2019t he, since the state court is unlikely to rule on the personal jurisdiction question in the first thirty days? It would be a tough rule that tells this defendant: \u2018\u2018remove if you like, but if you do you are consenting to suit in this state.\u2019\u2019 The rules don\u2019t put a defendant to this choice, because he does not waive his objection to personal jurisdiction in Utah by removing; he simply changes the court in which the question will be decided. After removal, the Utah federal court, instead of the state court, will decide whether the defendant is subject to jurisdiction in Utah.

That\u2019s understandable. In studying personal jurisdiction, we read common law cases in which the defendant \u2018\u2018appears specially\u2019\u2019 to object to jurisdiction. Then we study pleadings and motions under the Federal Rules, and along comes a different approach to jurisdictional objections. It\u2019s easy enough to mix them up. The special appearance was the common law\u2019s rather formalistic approach to raising objections to personal jurisdiction. A defendant who claimed that the court in which suit was filed lacked jurisdiction over her would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 to contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The defendant making a special appearance had to do so before answering the complaint on the merits, and she had to confine her argument to the lack of jurisdiction. If she raised any other issue, the court would hold that she had entered a \u2018\u2018general appearance\u2019\u2019 by litigating issues other than jurisdiction. Any reference to the merits, or even to other types of preliminary objections, could lead the court to conclude that, by appearing to litigate other issues, the defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and waived her objection to personal jurisdiction. In the federal courts, and in the many states that have modeled their procedural rules after the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, objections to personal jurisdiction are governed by Rule 12. The common law special appearance does not apply. But Rule 12 bears some resemblance to its common law ancestor. It still requires that the objection be asserted in the first response to the complaint, either a pre-answer motion or answer. And it still provides that the objection is waived if it isn\u2019t raised in a timely manner. The major difference, however, is that a defendant who moves to dismiss in federal court under Rule 12 for lack of jurisdiction may, in the same motion, assert other pre-answer defenses. She could, for example, move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to join an indispensable party. If she raised those two objections in a jurisdiction that adheres to the older special appearance approach, she would be deemed to waive her objection to personal jurisdiction by also raising an issue that is presumably only relevant if the court has jurisdiction. Here are two examples to help sort these matters out. They both involve cases removed to federal court. Keep in mind that in a removed case, state procedure applies until removal.

Goloupolos sues Hue in state court, in a state that uses the special appearance approach to objections to personal jurisdiction. Hue responds by filing an objection in the state court to personal jurisdiction, and a motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim. Five days later, before the court rules on his objections, he removes the action to federal court. After removal, he moves to dismiss, on the ground that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him. Goloupolos argues that the defense has been waived. The court will probably rule that Hue has\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nwaived the objection to personal jurisdiction, because his state court response constituted a general appearance.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo B is probably right. Hue waived the objection before removing. Since the objection was waived before removal, it can\u2019t be revived by removal. It makes no difference that he could have raised both defenses together in federal court (D). He certainly could have done that, if he had responded in federal court under Rule 12. But he didn\u2019t respond in federal court; he responded in state court, and state procedure applies until the case is removed. A caveat is in order here. I\u2019ve had some battles with a colleague over this one. He argues that the objection is not waived, since no decision was made in state court before removal that Hue had waived his objection. In his view, when the motion is renewed in federal court, the federal court should apply federal standards. Send me your thoughts.

For example, a lawyer might be asked to produce a statement she had taken from a witness to the events in suit, or an index she had made of a file containing large numbers of documents in a client\u2019s possession, or a memo to a partner stating which documents in the client\u2019s files were relevant to the opposing party\u2019s claim. Such documents, created in the course of representation and for the purpose of preparing the case, are clearly relevant to the issues in the case, under Rule 26(b)(1). Yet allowing discovery of these materials would severely impact lawyers\u2019 practices, since they could reveal counsel\u2019s case evaluation and trial strategy to the opposing party. In Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947), the Supreme Court held that such \u2018\u2018attorney work product\u2019\u2019 should be protected from disclosure, at least absent a showing of a particular need for the information and inability to obtain it through other means. The Court was concerned that discovery of trial preparation materials would interfere with lawyers\u2019 ability to develop their case strategy in private, and lead lawyers to build their cases by forcing disclosure of opposing counsel\u2019s efforts rather than undertaking their own. Thus, the Court created a limited objection to shield work product materials from discovery. This is an additional limit on access to materials, even if they satisfy the broad relevance standard in Rule 26(b)(1). In 1970, Rule 26(b)(3), entitled \u2018\u2018Trial Preparation: Materials\u2019\u2019 was added to the Federal Rules. That Rule partially codifies the protection Hickman provided to work product materials. Under Rule 26(b)(3), trial preparation materials are protected from discovery if three criteria are met. The materials must be \u2018\u2018documents or tangible things.\u2019\u2019 They must be \u2018\u2018prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial,\u2019\u2019 and they must be prepared \u2018\u2018by or for another party or its representative. . . .\u2019\u2019 If these criteria are met, the materials need not ordinarily be produced in discovery. So, the first issue to consider in analyzing a claim of work product protection is whether the materials are presumptively protected. That depends on the three criteria in Rule 26(b)(3)(A). Not all documents in the possession of a lawyer are trial preparation materials. Suppose, for example, that Jackson is defending the City police department on a charge of unlawful arrest, and the chief of police sends him a copy of the booking sheet concerning the arrest and the arresting officer\u2019s report about the incident that gave rise to the arrest. These are not trial preparation materials. They are \u2018\u2018documents or tangible things,\u2019\u2019 and they are prepared by or for another party (the police department) but they are not \u2018\u2018prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\u2019\u2019 They are simply the general business records of the police department, made as a matter of routine in every case, whether litigation may follow or not. Although they were sent to counsel in the course of defending the case, that is not enough to make them work product. If it were, all documents would be shielded from discovery simply because they were sent to counsel. If a document meets the criteria for work product under Rule 26(b) (3)(A), the presumptive protection for such materials may still be overcome in some circumstances. Under the rule, the court may order production of protected materials if the party seeking them shows that it has \u2018\u2018substantial need for the materials to prepare its case\u2019\u2019 and cannot obtain their substantial equivalent by other means. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3)(A)(ii). However, even if the requesting party cannot otherwise obtain the material, some items may not be discoverable under Rule 26(b)(3). Work product need not be produced, even if a substantial need is shown, if it would reveal \u2018\u2018the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party\u2019s attorney or other representative concerning the litigation.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(B). It may be helpful to think of Rule 26(b)(3) in terms of a decision tree: Step #1: Is the material a document or tangible thing? Was it prepared by or for another party? Was it prepared in anticipation of litigation? If the answer to these questions is \u2018\u2018yes,\u2019\u2019 the document enjoys presumptive protection under Rule 26(b)(3). Then go on to Step #2. Step #2: Does the requesting party have a substantial need for the material in preparing its case? Is it unable to obtain equivalent information by other means? If the answer to both questions is \u2018\u2018yes,\u2019\u2019 it will have to be produced despite presumptive work product protection. . . . unless . . . Step #3: Would the material reveal the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of counsel? If yes, such opinions, etc., will be protected from discovery in almost all cases, despite surviving Steps #1 and #2. This protection for trial preparation materials in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3) is usually referred to as the \u2018\u2018work product doctrine,\u2019\u2019 or the \u2018\u2018protection for trial preparation material,\u2019\u2019 rather than as a privilege. This reflects the fact that work product protection, unlike a privilege, can be outweighed, under Hickman or under Rule 26(b)(3), by a sufficient showing of need. But the doctrine is loosely referred to as a privilege in a good many opinions, and in at least some situations it is treated as one.

It does not apply where a party seeks a statement of a nonparty. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nRule 26(b)(3) governs work product objections to production of \u2018\u2018documents and tangible things.\u2019\u2019 However, it has been clear since Hickman that a party may object to production of work product that is not embodied in a document or tangible thing. For example, in Hickman, opposing counsel sought production of Fortenbaugh\u2019s recollections of his interviews with witnesses, as well as his notes of other interviews. Rule 26(b)(3) would not protect this information, since it is not a \u2018\u2018document or tangible thing.\u2019\u2019 It isn\u2019t clear why the rulemakers, in drafting Rule 26(b)(3), chose to address only work product objections to production of documents and tangible things. It might be argued that, since they chose to protect these from disclosure (unless the appropriate showing is made), by implication, other work product\u2014that is, intangible work product like Fortenbaugh\u2019s recollections of witness interviews\u2014are not protected. However, this has not been the reading of the courts. Most courts have held that intangible work product continues to enjoy protection under standards established in the Hickman case itself. Thus, they need not be produced absent some showing of extraordinary need. See, e.g., Sporck v. Peil, 759 F.2d 312 (3d Cir. 1985). And \u2018\u2018opinion work product\u2019\u2019\u2014the mental impressions of counsel\u2014is probably protected from disclosure in almost all cases. So, consider the following worthy Closer.  A good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties\u2019 relative access to relevant information, the parties\u2019 resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of \u2018\u2018any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.\u2019\u2019 In an effort to rein in discovery, the \u2018\u2018relevant to the claim or defense of any party\u2019\u2019 language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to \u2018\u2018the subject matter of the pending action,\u2019\u2019 but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called \u2018\u2018proportionality factors\u2019\u2019 in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the \u2018\u2018relevant to a claim or defense in the action\u2019\u2019 standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff\u2019s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants\u2019 arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is discoverable even though it isn\u2019t admissible as evidence at a trial. \u2018\u2018Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\u2019\u2019 For example, statements that are \u2018\u2018hearsay,\u2019\u2019 that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here\u2019s a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).  Because the standard for relevance in Rule 26(b)(1), as amended in 2000, is tied to the claims and defenses in the case, the parties\u2019 pleadings play an important role in determining the scope of discovery. By raising issues in the pleadings, the parties lay themselves open to discovery on issues which otherwise might remain free from inquiry. Prior to the amendment, the pleadings were less central to the scope of discovery, since any information relevant to \u2018\u2018the subject matter of the action,\u2019\u2019 rather than the \u2018\u2018claims or defenses\u2019\u2019 raised by the parties was subject to discovery. In the following question, consider whether the information sought is relevant to the claims and defenses of the parties.    \n\nQuestion:\n8. Exceeding the limits? Sorenson sues Marathon Corporation in federal court for the fee he had earned as the broker after he had assisted Marathon in acquiring a family business. He seeks his commission, damages for fraud, and statutory damages under a state statute. DeMarco, Sorenson\u2019s counsel, takes the deposition of Sanchez, an independent accountant who audited Marathon\u2019s business, and had been involved in the negotiations and planning for the acquisition. At the outset of the deposition, DeMarco asks Sanchez whether the company\u2019s lawyers, in preparing him for his deposition, had noted any particularly problematic issues they expected to come up at the deposition, and what areas of inquiry they had spent most of their time discussing. Marathon\u2019s counsel objects based on the work product doctrine and attorney-client privilege. The objection should probably be\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nsustained, based on the attorney-client privilege.\n\nAnalysis:\nA is not right. The attorney-client privilege extends to communications between lawyer and client, but here the witness is not the client or even the employee of a client. If the information sought is protected, it will have to be under the work product doctrine, not attorney-client privilege. But Rule 26(b)(3), by its terms, does not provide such protection. It extends work product protection to \u2018\u2018documents and tangible things.\u2019\u2019 The questions here seek oral testimony concerning Sanders\u2019s conversations with Marathon\u2019s counsel, so the rule does not apply. B is wrong. Although Rule 26(b)(3) doesn\u2019t apply, E, which takes the position that the objection should be overruled, is not the best answer either. The case law has held that Rule 26(b)(3) has partially codified the work product protection recognized in Hickman. It governs where the material sought to be protected is found in documents or tangible things. But, where similar work product information not included in a document or tangible thing is sought, the cases look back to Hickman and extend similar protection to the material. In other words, Rule 26(b)(3) is not the exclusive source of work product protection. Attorneys\u2019 mental processes can still be protected under the common law protection stemming from Hickman as well. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nIf a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement? Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This \u2018\u2018aggregation\u2019\u2019 problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot \u2018\u2018aggregate\u2019\u2019 claims against different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a \u2018\u2018common, undivided interest.\u2019\u2019 (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not.

Frequently, a plaintiff sues two or more defendants on a tort claim for injuries arguably worth more than $75,000.

He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith\u2019s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount.

Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe \u2018\u2018jointly and severally liable\u2019\u2019 for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence.

When litigation eventuates, opposing lawyers generally want it all. In big cases, this can make discovery hugely expensive and especially contentious. The Federal Rules now contain several provisions to assist judges in handling the problems posed by electronic discovery: \u2022 Rules 33(d) and 34(a)(1)(A) expressly provide that \u2018\u2018electronically stored information\u2019\u2019 is subject to discovery. There has never been much doubt that such information is discoverable, but it\u2019s clear now that it is. \u2022 Rule 26(b)(2)(B) provides that parties need not provide electronic information that is \u2018\u2018not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost.\u2019\u2019 The burden falls on the party who objects on this basis to show that the information is not reasonably accessible. If the party carries that burden, the court may still order production, but only for good cause and under appropriate provisions (such as cost sharing). This emphasizes that the burden of producing information is an important factor in limiting discovery and calls on the judge to make careful judgments about whether and how much of this information must be produced. \u2022 Rule 37\u2014which addresses sanctions for inadequate participation in discovery\u2014expressly addresses failure to preserve electronically stored information relevant to anticipated or current litigation. Rule 37(e)(1) authorizes the court to impose orders\u2014 such as measures to retrieve the information, allowing evidence of the loss of the information, or barring evidence about a claim or defense to which the missing evidence is relevant. For intentional destruction of such evidence, Rule 37(e)(2) allows more drastic sanctions, up to and including a default judgment or dismissal of a violator\u2019s claim. \u2022 Rule 26(b)(5)(B) addresses another problem intensified by electronic discovery. Because parties often produce huge masses of material in electronic discovery exchanges, they will sometimes discover that, without meaning to, they have produced documents that were privileged or subject to work product protection. Rule 26(b)(5)(B) allows a party who has made such an \u2018\u2018inadvertent disclosure\u2019\u2019 to notify the receiving party of the mistake. If so notified, the receiving party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim [of privilege or work product protection]. The producing party must preserve the information until the claim is resolved. This provision attempts to freeze the status quo until the producing party\u2019s claim of privilege can be resolved. It does not provide that the information is still privileged despite its inadvertent production; rather, it bars any use of it until a court determines whether producing it in discovery has waived the right to keep it confidential. The question below probes the meaning of this quizzical provision.\n\nQuestion:\n8. Gimme, Gimme! Black Corporation sues White Corporation for patent infringement. The case involves very large numbers of files, some electronic, others in print, that contain technical data about the development of a complex turbine for generating energy from the tides. After Black produces its files in response to White\u2019s request for production, it discovers that it has mistakenly produced to White\u2019s lawyers a hard copy of a memo written by its chief engineer, Pasco. Pasco wrote the memo after the suit was filed, offering her assessment to Black\u2019s board of directors of the overlap between Black\u2019s turbine design and White\u2019s, to assist the board in deciding whether to litigate or settle the case.

He agrees that the note is the only writing evidencing the contract, but takes the position that, as a matter of law, it is insufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds. In effect, he admits that there is \u2018\u2018no genuine dispute of material fact\u2019\u2019 about the writing, but takes the position that Maxwell is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, since the writing he has produced doesn\u2019t satisfy the statute of frauds.

R. Civ. P. 50(b). Rule 50(b) provides that, if a motion for a judgment as a matter of law is denied, the motion may be renewed no later than twenty-eight days after entry of judgment. This establishes two prerequisites for the motion. First, it must be made within twenty-eight days after judgment is entered on the jury\u2019s verdict for the plaintiff. Second, the party moving for judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) before the case went to the jury. There is an important practical reason for the requirement that a party who seeks judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for a judgment before the case is submitted to the jury. A party seeking judgment as a matter of law before the case goes to the jury must state the grounds for her position that the plaintiff\u2019s case is too weak. In Question 1, for example, Vicaro would state as grounds for the motion the lack of evidence of the relevant standard of medical care, that his treatment fell below that standard of care, or that his treatment caused Powers\u2019s condition. Now (while it\u2019s unlikely with such a glaring omission), it may be that Powers has this evidence and simply neglected to introduce it. If that is true, Vicaro\u2019s motion acts as a wake-up call to Powers\u2019s lawyer. When the defendant points out the gap in her evidence, she will ask the judge to allow her to reopen her case to offer the omitted evidence. Since a trial is a quest for truth rather than a game of skill, the judge should allow her to do so, absent unfair surprise to Vicaro. So, by requiring the challenge to the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s case at a point where the omission can be remedied, Rule 50(b) facilitates the trial of the case on the merits. In the federal courts, there is a second reason for the prior-motion requirement in order to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Supreme Court held, in a dubious decision, that reconsidering the jury\u2019s verdict violates the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial, unless the judge reserved the right to do so on a motion made before the case went to the jury.

Reliance on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation is a required element of a claim for negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ndeny the motion, since she already determined, by denying the prior motion, that Uberoth\u2019s evidence was sufficient to go to the jury.\n\nAnalysis:\nIt suggests that the judge, by denying the earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law, has determined that Uberoth\u2019s evidence is sufficient, so this issue is settled. The fact that the judge denies a motion for a directed verdict does not always mean that she has concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s case is adequately supported by the evidence. It may simply mean that she is reserving judgment, perhaps hoping that the jury will settle the issue by finding for the defendant. The very point of Rule 50(b) is that the denial of a prior motion under Rule 50(a) does not inevitably mean that the judge considers the evidence sufficient. It may simply reflect her desire to \u2018\u2018save the trial\u2019\u2019 by ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence after the verdict rather than before. The right answer here flows from the rationale for the Rule 50(b) requirement that the motion for judgment be made before the case goes to the jury, in order to preserve the right to seek judgment notwithstanding the verdict after a verdict. Here, Colon moved for a directed verdict before the case went to the jury, on the ground that the evidence did not show that he knew that the statements he made about the investment were false. This motion put Uberoth on notice of a possible weakness in his proof of this element of his case. If he had further evidence about Colon\u2019s knowledge that the statements were false, he could ask the court to allow him to reopen his case, and submit that proof. But the motion on this ground did not put Uberoth on notice that his proof of reliance, a separate element, was inadequate. When Colon moves for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on this ground, the challenge comes out of the blue, at a time when Uberoth can no longer do anything about it. In the language of poker, Colon has \u2018\u2018sandbagged\u2019\u2019 Uberoth by keeping this objection in his back pocket, letting the case go to the jury and raising the reliance issue after the jury\u2019s verdict, when it is too late to offer any further evidence of reliance. Of course, it\u2019s true that it\u2019s Uberoth\u2019s case to prove. He should know the elements of a claim for fraud, and assumes the responsibility of proving them at trial. If he hasn\u2019t proven one of them, perhaps he should take the consequences. But the point of the Rule 50(b) requirement of a prior Rule 50(a) motion is to put him on notice of the defect before the case goes to the jury, and Colon didn\u2019t put him on notice of the defect in proof of reliance at that point. It is not enough that he moved for judgment as a matter of law on some ground to preserve his right to judgment as a matter of law after the verdict. His motion must raise the objection he renews in the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nIn federal court, the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). Rule 50(b) provides that, if a motion for a judgment as a matter of law is denied, the motion may be renewed no later than twenty-eight days after entry of judgment. This establishes two prerequisites for the motion. First, it must be made within twenty-eight days after judgment is entered on the jury\u2019s verdict for the plaintiff. Second, the party moving for judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) before the case went to the jury. There is an important practical reason for the requirement that a party who seeks judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for a judgment before the case is submitted to the jury. A party seeking judgment as a matter of law before the case goes to the jury must state the grounds for her position that the plaintiff\u2019s case is too weak. In Question 1, for example, Vicaro would state as grounds for the motion the lack of evidence of the relevant standard of medical care, that his treatment fell below that standard of care, or that his treatment caused Powers\u2019s condition. Now (while it\u2019s unlikely with such a glaring omission), it may be that Powers has this evidence and simply neglected to introduce it. If that is true, Vicaro\u2019s motion acts as a wake-up call to Powers\u2019s lawyer. When the defendant points out the gap in her evidence, she will ask the judge to allow her to reopen her case to offer the omitted evidence. Since a trial is a quest for truth rather than a game of skill, the judge should allow her to do so, absent unfair surprise to Vicaro. So, by requiring the challenge to the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s case at a point where the omission can be remedied, Rule 50(b) facilitates the trial of the case on the merits. In the federal courts, there is a second reason for the prior-motion requirement in order to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Supreme Court held, in a dubious decision, that reconsidering the jury\u2019s verdict violates the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial, unless the judge reserved the right to do so on a motion made before the case went to the jury. Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman, 295 U.S. 654 (1935). Consider how the prior-motion rule should apply in the following case.\n\nQuestion:\n7. Second time around. Uberoth, a venture capitalist, sues Colon, an investment broker, in federal court. He alleges that Colon fraudulently induced Uberoth to invest in an internet start-up company, by knowingly making false statements about its prospects and the backgrounds of its officers. The case goes to trial. At the close of the evidence, Colon moves for a judgment as a matter of law, on the ground that Uberoth has not produced enough evidence to support a verdict that Colon knew, at the time he made the statements, that they were false. The judge denies the motion, and the jury subsequently returns a verdict finding Colon liable for the misrepresentation. After the jury\u2019s verdict, but before a judgment has been entered on the verdict, Colon moves for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. He argues that Uberoth had produced no evidence that he had actually relied on Colon\u2019s statements about the company\u2019s prospects in making his investment. Reliance on the defendant\u2019s misrepresentation is a required element of a claim for negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ngrant the motion if she concludes that no reasonable jury could conclude that Uberoth relied on Colon\u2019s statements in making the investment.\n\nAnalysis:\nAlthough D seems like it should be right, Colon will have forfeited his right to judgment on this ground by failing to raise it before the case goes to the jury. This is one more illustration of a basic point: procedure matters. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nSuppose that the losing party at trial believes that she has grounds both to seek a new trial and to seek judgment as a matter of law?

In federal court, she would presumably move for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) on that ground. And, if she views the evidence as that weak, she must also view the jury\u2019s verdict as \u2018\u2018against the great weight of the evidence,\u2019\u2019 a ground for a new trial. And, just to make things more interesting, assume as well that she believes the judge\u2019s instruction on causation was wrong. What should Knox do? Well, what would you do? You would make both motions, of course. Naturally, you would prefer that the judge granted your motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), because then you would win outright. But if she won\u2019t do that, you\u2019d certainly like to live to fight another day, by getting a new trial. Federal Rule 50(c) deals with such combined motions. It requires the judge to rule on both motions. If she is inclined to grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law, she should do so, but, under Rule 50(c)(1), she should also rule \u2018\u2018conditionally\u2019\u2019 on the motion for a new trial as well. For example, she might rule as follows: The defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law is granted, since the jury\u2019s finding that the accident resulted from the negligence of Knox is not supported by sufficient evidence to support a rational verdict. However, in the alternative, I find that the jury\u2019s verdict is also against the great weight of the evidence, and I therefore conditionally grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. However, I deny the motion for a new trial based on the causation instruction, since the instruction given accurately reflects the law in this jurisdiction. The trial judge, by ruling on all the motions, facilitates full appellate review of the case. If there is an appeal, the appellate court can review all of the trial judge\u2019s rulings in a single, consolidated appeal.

Both orders are appealable. If the appellate court concludes (after reversing the judgment for Orwell) that the new trial was properly granted, it will remand for the new trial.

She has concluded that the evidence is too weak to support a verdict for Parkins. Consequently, Orwell is the winner. Judgment should enter for him.

When the judge does that, she is saying, \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve taken the verdict away from Parkins and ordered judgment entered for Orwell, because the evidence is too weak to support a rational verdict for Parkins. So I\u2019m granting judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) for Orwell. Rule 50(c)(1) tells me I have to rule on the new trial motion too, so I\u2019m stating that, if the appellate court reverses my Rule 50(b) ruling, I would grant a new trial in this case, because the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence.\u2019\u2019 Fine, but where does the case go from there?

Yes, that is possible, but by failing to present the claims in Suit One, Pelham has denied the court the opportunity to litigate the entire controversy in one action. Res judicata will apply.

This requirement seems arbitrary and technical, even silly. But let\u2019s try to understand why courts have consistently included this mysterious limitation on collateral estoppel. Cambria v. Jeffrey, 307 Mass. 49 (1940), provides a classic example of the problem. In slightly simplified form, the facts were as follows: Cambria had an accident with Jeffrey and sued Jeffrey for negligence in causing his injuries. Jeffrey pleaded contributory negligence. At the time of this crusty case, contributory negligence of a plaintiff barred recovery entirely, even if the defendant was negligent too. The case was tried before a judge, not a jury. The judge found that Cambria was negligent, and that Jeffrey was negligent as well. Question: What judgment should the judge enter based on these factual findings? He should dismiss Cambria\u2019s suit. Under the contributory negligence doctrine, a plaintiff who was partially at fault in causing the accident could not recover. The plaintiff had to be blameless to recover, and Cambria was negligent, so he lost. But that wasn\u2019t the end of it. After the judge dismissed Cambria\u2019s suit, Jeffrey sued Cambria for his injuries. (At the time Massachusetts had no compulsory counterclaim rule, so Jeffrey had not waived his claim by failing to assert it in the first action.) Predictably, Cambria pleaded that Jeffrey was contributorily negligent, and asserted that Jeffrey was estopped from denying his negligence, since the judge in the first suit had found that he was. This isn\u2019t a bad argument; the parties litigated Jeffrey\u2019s negligence in Suit One, and the judge decided that he was negligent, so why should Jeffrey be allowed to litigate it again? Despite this logic, the court in Cambria v. Jeffrey held that Jeffrey could litigate it again, because the judge\u2019s finding in the first suit that Jeffrey was negligent was not \u2018\u2018necessary to the judgment.\u2019\u2019 Question: What finding was necessary to the judgment in Suit One? Why did Cambria lose? If you think about it, it\u2019s clear that Cambria did not lose because Jeffrey was negligent . . . that finding would tend to support liability! No, he lost because he (Cambria) was negligent. At the time, a contributorily negligent plaintiff could not win, whether the defendant was negligent or not. Thus, Cambria\u2019s negligence led to the judgment, but the finding that Jeffrey was negligent was irrelevant to the outcome in the first action. Because the judge in the first action never had to decide whether Jeffrey was negligent, that finding was a form of dicta. The finding didn\u2019t affect the outcome, so the judge may not have given it the same serious consideration he would have if it would affect the result. Thus, we can\u2019t have quite the level of confidence in this irrelevant conclusion that we have in a finding that leads to the judgment in the case. There\u2019s another problem with findings that don\u2019t lead to the judgment. They are, usually, unreviewable: Question: Put yourself in Jeffrey\u2019s shoes. The judge has found him negligent. He contemplates a suit against Cambria for his own injuries in the accident. What would he want to do if he feared that he would be estopped from relitigating his negligence in the second action? Naturally, if Jeffrey fears being stuck with the finding that he was negligent, he would want to appeal it and get it reversed, so it would not come back to haunt him in his later suit for his own injuries. Question: If Jeffrey appealed the judge\u2019s finding in the first action that he was negligent, what would the appellate court do? Very likely, the appellate court would say, \u2018\u2018What are you doing here, Jeffrey? You won below. Why should we review the finding that you were negligent? The issue is moot. Even if we agreed with you, it wouldn\u2019t change the outcome, so why should we waste our time reviewing an irrelevant conclusion?\u2019\u2019 And how could they meaningfully review it? If Jeffrey appealed, why would Cambria spend the money to oppose the appeal? He lost anyway, he isn\u2019t likely to litigate an appeal about Jeffrey\u2019s negligence out of pure curiosity. So, Jeffrey would probably not be able to obtain appellate review of the trial judge\u2019s finding that he was negligent. Since the finding did not affect the outcome, and can\u2019t be corrected on appeal, most courts would not give collateral estoppel effect to it. The trick, of course, is to distinguish such miscellaneous findings from those that do affect the outcome, that are \u2018\u2018necessary to the judgment.\u2019\u2019 Consider this case.\n\nQuestion:\n9. Triple play. Perez sues the City of Atlantis, alleging that the mayor violated his First Amendment rights by demoting him from his city job to a lower-paying one because he had supported Appolonia, the losing candidate for mayor in the 2018 election. The City raises three defenses. It denies that Perez was demoted, arguing that he was transferred to an equivalent position. Second, it claims that the mayor never believed that Perez supported Appolonia, so could not have discriminated against him on that basis. Last, it claims that Perez had waived any claim for demotion when he agreed to accept his new position. The case went to trial on all three issues. The jury rendered a general verdict, finding the City liable to Perez for violating his First Amendment rights. A year later, Perez is fired. He sues again, claiming that he was fired in violation of his First Amendment rights, because the mayor believed he had supported Appolonia in the 2018 election.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nPerez may not estop the City from relitigating whether the mayor believed that Perez had supported Appolonia. Since the City raised three defenses, we cannot tell which findings were necessary to the judgment in the first case.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo we know what they decided on each of these issues. Which of these findings was necessary to the judgment? They all were. The jury had to reject all three defenses in order to render a verdict for Perez. They couldn\u2019t find for Perez without rejecting all three defenses. If, for example, they had found that the mayor had not believed that Perez had supported Appolonia, they would not have awarded damages for violation of his First Amendment rights in demoting him for it. Consequently, their finding on this issue was necessary to the outcome in the first suit. And the same is true of the other two defenses. Thus, C is wrong, because, if the jury had reached a different result on any one of these three defenses, the City would have won. But it didn\u2019t, so the jury must have rejected them all, and rejecting all three led to the verdict they returned. Here, it\u2019s B as in \u2018\u2018Best.\u2019\u2019\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe cases we\u2019ve analyzed so far have involved situations in which one of the parties to Suit One invokes collateral estoppel in a later action between the same parties. Suppose, for example, that Smith sues Doe, and loses on Issue A. The same issue then arises again in a later suit between Smith and Doe, and Doe invokes collateral estoppel to bar Smith from relitigating it. This is a case of \u2018\u2018mutual collateral estoppel,\u2019\u2019 because Doe, the party invoking estoppel in the second action was a party to the first, litigated it against Smith in that action, and prevailed on the issue in Suit One. However, an issue previously litigated and decided may arise in later litigation involving a new party as well. Suppose, for example, that Forrestal Corporation sues Quantum Software for infringing its patent, and loses because the jury finds that the patent is invalid. Subsequently, Forrestal sues Apex Corporation for infringing on the patent. Apex would like to invoke collateral estoppel, arguing that Forrestal litigated and lost on the patent issue in Suit One and should not be able to relitigate the issue. Under traditional principles of collateral estoppel, Apex could not invoke estoppel, because it was not a party to the first suit. Under the \u2018\u2018mutuality\u2019\u2019 doctrine, which still reigns in some jurisdictions, only the parties to the first action could invoke estoppel based on findings in that action. Apex, a stranger to Suit One, could not step in and use the finding from that suit to bar Forrestal from relitigating the validity issue. Other courts have moved away from mutuality, recognizing that, under some conditions, allowing a new party to invoke estoppel is fair. The key case on the point is Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979), in which the Supreme Court cautiously authorized federal trial judges to apply non-mutual estoppel in circumstances that ensure that the issue was fairly decided in the first action. However, while the federal courts and a good many state courts now allow non-mutual estoppel, all courts adhere to a fundamental requirement: that the party who is being estopped must have litigated and lost on the issue in the prior suit. The party invoking estoppel may be new, but the party who is barred from relitigating must have had its fair bite at the apple in the first suit. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to invoke estoppel to bar her from litigating the issue. In analyzing a non-mutual preclusion problem, start by asking who litigated the issues in the prior action. In a mutuality jurisdiction, only those parties may use estoppel in a later action. In a non-mutuality jurisdiction, estoppel can be used against a party who litigated and lost on an issue in the first suit. Here\u2019s a case that makes the point.\n\nQuestion:\n10. First Principles. Gotchall invested one million dollars with Faithful Investments Inc., on the basis of a brochure describing its mutual fund. Later, he sued Faithful in federal court. He claimed that Faithful\u2019s brochure promised a return of at least 15 percent. Faithful denied this, arguing that the materials were ambiguous about the likely return. After a trial without a jury, the judge found that the brochure did not guarantee any particular rate of return. She therefore entered judgment dismissing Gotschall\u2019s claim for damages. Later, Carmichael, who had also invested in the fund, sued Faithful for damages, basing his claim on the same argument as Gotschall\u2019s, that Faithful\u2019s brochure promised a return of at least 15 percent. Faithful moves for summary judgment, arguing that Carmichael is estopped from proving that the brochure misrepresented the likely return, since the judge had found for Faithful on the issue in the first suit. The court should hold that Carmichael\u2019s claim\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nis barred, because he should have joined as a coplaintiff with Gotschall in the prior action.\n\nAnalysis:\nA suggests that Carmichael is barred because he should have joined as a coplaintiff with Gotschall. However, while Rule 20(a) would allow him to join in that suit, it does not require him to do so; Rule 20(a) is permissive. (In fact there might be various reasons why Carmichael could not have joined, such as diversity problems.) More practically, who says he even knew about Gotschall\u2019s action?

Always ask whether the party who is being barred from litigating the issue litigated it before. If not, no estoppel!

The finding that the brochure did not promise a particular rate of return was necessary to the judgment. Gotschall based his claim on the fact that the brochure promised a 15 percent return, and he lost his case because the judge found that the brochure did not promise a specific rate of return, so that finding of fact did lead to the judgment. It was not dicta; it was the very basis for the decision that Gotschall could not recover. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThis is not the place to go into supplemental jurisdiction in detail\u2014we\u2019ll do that in Chapter 14. But it is useful to introduce the problem of cases that include some claims that satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction, but also others that do not. Very commonly, cases involve not one claim, but several\u2014perhaps two, or perhaps ten. Civil procedure has a nasty doctrine called res judicata, which provides that once you have sued a defendant for claims arising out of a set of events, you can\u2019t do it again. Consequently, lawyers know that whatever claims they have against a defendant arising from a particular dispute must be asserted when they bring suit the first time. Suppose, for example, that Greenstein, a New Yorker, sues Panil, another New Yorker, for infringing her patent, claiming that she had licensed Panil to use the patented device for limited purposes, but Panil had exceeded those limits. This claim arises under the federal patent statutes, so the federal court has arising-under jurisdiction to hear it. However, Greenstein might also allege a claim for breach of contract as well, based on the same acts by Panil. This is a state claim between two parties from the same state. It doesn\u2019t arise under federal law, and there\u2019s no diversity. If it were brought alone, the federal court would not have jurisdiction to hear it. But it wasn\u2019t brought alone; it was brought along with a proper federal claim and arises from the same events. It makes sense that it should be litigated along with the federal claim. But how can it be? Subject matter jurisdiction is fundamental, and what gives the federal court subject matter jurisdiction over Greenstein\u2019s contract claim? The Supreme Court has held that where the plaintiff asserts a claim that properly supports federal court jurisdiction, it is constitutionally permissible for the federal court to hear the entire dispute between the parties, including other claims that arise from the same \u2018\u2018nucleus of operative facts\u2019\u2019 but could not be brought in federal court alone. United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966). And Congress has conveyed such \u2018\u2018supplemental\u2019\u2019 jurisdiction to the federal district courts in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a), which authorizes the federal court, if it has jurisdiction over one claim, to hear other claims that are part of the same \u2018\u2018case or controversy.\u2019\u2019 Basically, a claim is part of the same case or controversy as the main claim (the one that gives the federal court jurisdiction) if it arises from the same set of underlying facts, the \u2018\u2018common nucleus of operative facts\u2019\u2019 test of Gibbs. So the bottom line is (a little oversimplified, but close enough until we get to Chapter 14) that a plaintiff who has asserted one substantial claim that properly invokes federal jurisdiction may have her entire dispute heard in federal court, including state law claims that couldn\u2019t otherwise be brought in federal court. Here\u2019s a basic illustration.\n\nQuestion:\n9. Tagging along. Isaacs, a Montana citizen, sues United Tool and Die Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Montana, under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). He sues in federal court. Isaacs claims that United fired him because of his age, replacing him with a younger employee. Isaacs also asserts a second claim in his complaint, alleging that firing him constituted a breach of his contract of employment. He asserts a third claim in the complaint, alleging that, a year before he was fired, United had misappropriated a design he created for a new grinding wheel. Isaacs claimed he had invented the wheel on his own, not in the course of his employment, so that United had no right to exploit the idea without his consent. The federal court has subject matter jurisdiction\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nover the first two claims, but not the third.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo D is the best answer. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim, because it arises from the same underlying dispute as the ADEA claim. But the misappropriation claim arises from other, only tangentially related events, and would not qualify under \u00a71367 (or under U.M.W. v. Gibbs) for supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nLabel:\n1", "Introduction:\nBecause the outer limits of federal subject matter jurisdiction are established in the Constitution, the federal courts are careful not to exceed those limits. Thus, they will almost always entertain objections to their jurisdiction, even if they were not raised at the outset of the case. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3) (whenever it appears that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, court shall dismiss the action). Thus, for example, the parties cannot consent to the federal court hearing a case over which it lacks jurisdiction.

Ivanov answers the complaint denying liability, and the parties proceed to engage in discovery. Ten months later, Taney becomes disenchanted with the federal judge assigned to hear the case.

I suppose the logic here is that, as long as it would not offend constitutional limits for the federal court to hear the case, it has the power to do so, even if the case does not satisfy Congress\u2019s statutory limits on arising-under jurisdiction. However, a federal court exceeds its authority when it exercises jurisdiction that Congress has not granted, just as it would if it exercised jurisdiction not within the constitutional grant. So, the court will dismiss a case that is not authorized by statute, as well as one that goes beyond the Article III constitutional grant. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nBecause the outer limits of federal subject matter jurisdiction are established in the Constitution, the federal courts are careful not to exceed those limits.

Isn\u2019t he manipulating the system, and shouldn\u2019t he be estopped from denying jurisdiction, in order to discourage such manipulation? There\u2019s a fair argument for that view, but other considerations outweigh the risk of manipulation. Federal subject matter jurisdiction involves more than the interests of the parties. It implicates the constitutional balance between the federal and state governments. In order to assure that federal courts don\u2019t exceed their constitutional authority, they will always entertain a challenge to their subject matter jurisdiction. After all, if the federal court exercises jurisdiction over a case it lacks the power to hear, the resulting judgment will be subject to reversal on appeal, since a judgment rendered without the power to enter it is invalid. To avoid such wasteful and unconstitutional exercises, the trial court will always consider challenges to its jurisdiction. \u2018\u2018If the court determines at any time that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction, the court must dismiss the action.\u2019\u2019 Fed.

The objection of lack of subject matter jurisdiction is never waived\u2014at least, it remains subject to direct attack on appeal, even if no objection was raised in the trial court. In Mottley, for example, the issue was raised by the Supreme Court itself. Federal Rule 12(h)(3) confirms that this is true throughout the litigation in the trial court, even if it is the plaintiff who raises the problem. Consider what would happen if the rule were otherwise: Suppose that the parties wanted to litigate a case in federal court that did not satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiff could file suit in federal court, and the defendant could simply fail to object. If such a failure to raise jurisdictional defects authorized the federal court to hear the case, the parties could evade the constitutional limits on federal judicial power. Of course, the federal judge might note the lack of jurisdiction on her own motion, and dismiss, but the limits on federal judicial power should not be left to discretion or to chance.3 So Taney has not waived the right to make the motion by failing to raise the jurisdiction issue earlier. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nMy students always get confused about the relationship between removal to federal court and personal jurisdiction.

But that motion is not likely to be ruled on within thirty days, and if she\u2019s going to remove, she\u2019s got to do it within thirty days. So she could do one of two things: She could move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in the state court (assuming that the state rules allow her to do that) and then remove to federal court within the thirty-day period. Her motion would then be pending in federal court instead of state court, and the federal court would rule on it. Or she could remove the case before a response was due in state court, and then, after removal, raise her objection to personal jurisdiction by a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss or in her answer to the complaint in federal court. Either way, the point is that removal does not waive the defendant\u2019s right to object to personal jurisdiction. It simply changes the court in which the objection will be litigated. It is true that, after removal, the question will be whether the federal court has personal jurisdiction. But generally the scope of personal jurisdiction in the federal court will be the same as that of the state court, because the Federal Rules require the federal court in most cases to conform to state limits on personal jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A). I\u2019ve stumped a multitude of students on this point. Consider the following two cases to clarify the point.\n\nQuestion:\n8. Another switch. Yasuda, from Oregon, sues Boyle, from Idaho, on a state law unfair competition claim, seeking $250,000 in damages. He sues in state court in Oregon. Assume that Oregon follows the special appearance rule, under which the defendant may appear to challenge jurisdiction, but waives the objection if she raises any other issues. Boyle answers the complaint in state court, raising her defenses on the merits and including an objection to personal jurisdiction. Three days later Boyle files a notice of removal in federal court. Five days after removing, Boyle renews her motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Boyle\u2019s motion is\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nnot waived by removal. The court should dismiss if there is no personal jurisdiction over Boyle in Oregon, even though the case was properly removed.\n\nAnalysis:\n\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe removal statute provides that \u2018\u2018all defendants who have been properly joined and served as defendants must join in or consent to the removal.\u2019\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a71446(b)(2)(a).

The rationale for this short window for most motions to remand is the same as the rationale for the first thirty-day period for removing the case: Both courts need to know where the case is going to be litigated.

The motion should be\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ngranted, because the amount-in-controversy requirement is not met. Tyrgyz seeks $120,000, which only works out to $60,000 each. This objection does not come too late, since objections to subject matter are not covered by the thirty-day limit on most objections to removal.\n\nAnalysis:\nA is very tempting. It is true that objections to federal subject matter jurisdiction don\u2019t have to be raised within the thirty-day period for objections to removal. See \u00a71447(c) (objections \u2018\u2018other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 must be made within thirty days after filing of the notice of removal). But the amount-in-controversy requirement is met here. Tyrgyz claims that either Boch or Ivens caused his injury, he doesn\u2019t know which. So there is a legitimate claim for that amount against each. See Chapter 2, pp. 21-22. If the jury concludes that Boch caused the harm, he could be held liable for $120,000. If it concludes that Ivens caused it, she will. If it concludes that neither is liable, Tyrgyz will lose. But he still has asserted a colorable claim for $120,000 against each defendant, and might recover that amount from either. So A is wrong. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe removal statute provides that \u2018\u2018all defendants who have been properly joined and served as defendants must join in or consent to the removal.\u2019\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a71446(b)(2)(a).

In fact, it continues to give rise to a great deal of fact-specific litigation, applying Shoe\u2019s general principles to the myriad facts of human experience. But the real kicker for my students has been the stream-of-commerce problem addressed\u2014or obfuscated\u2014in Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102 (1987) and revisited by the Court in J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro, 131 S. Ct. 2780 (2011). This section probes the meaning of so-called stream-of-commerce jurisdiction. \u2018\u2018Stream of commerce\u2019\u2019 is a phrase that refers to the entry of a defendant\u2019s products into the forum state through commercial channels of distribution. For example, suppose that Snoflake Incorporated makes snowblowers in Nevada and sells them to a wholesaler in Oregon, which resells them to retail stores in ten states, including Wyoming. If Wakimoto buys a Snoflake snowblower at a hardware store in Wyoming and is injured using it in Wyoming, will a Wyoming court have personal jurisdiction over Snowflake for his claim? Snoflake did not sell the snowblower in Wyoming itself. It may or may not have known that the wholesaler would resell its product there. But it did sell its product into the stream of commerce with the hope that it would be sold widely, and with knowledge that, if it was defective, it could injure a user wherever it was bought and used. And, of course, it cheerfully accepted the profits derived, ultimately, from sales in Wyoming. The stream-of-commerce question is whether Snoflake\u2019s sale of the product to the wholesaler in Oregon, with the hope and expectation that it would be resold to consumers in other states, establishes a sufficient contact with the final purchaser\u2019s state to support personal jurisdiction where Wakimoto buys and uses it and is injured by it. This is an important question, to which the Supreme Court has given only an equivocal answer. In World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson, the Court appeared to suggest that selling into the stream of commerce in one state, which leads to resale to consumers in a different state, would support jurisdiction there if the consumer was injured where she bought it (not where she took it, as World-Wide holds). See World-Wide, 444 U.S. at 297 (jurisdiction appropriate where injury results from manufacturer or distributor\u2019s efforts to \u2018\u2018serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in other states\u2019\u2019). But the Court later divided on this issue in Asahi. In Asahi, the defendant made a component that was incorporated into a final product in another country and resold into California. The question was whether the component maker had sufficient contacts with California to support jurisdiction, when a consumer bought the product there and was injured by it there. Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion suggested that a defendant that merely sold its product to another company, without controlling where that other company would redistribute it as part of its final product, was not subject to jurisdiction where the finished product was ultimately sold. Jurisdiction, Justice O\u2019Connor suggested, is based on purposeful availment, and the mere sale of a part\u2014or 100,000 parts\u2014from Japan to Taiwan did not establish minimum contacts with California. Instead, she would require that a defendant like Asahi actually establish direct contacts in the consumer\u2019s state to subject it to suit there for injuries caused by its products sold in the state. She would find such \u2018\u2018purposeful availment\u2019\u2019 if the defendant establishes sales agents in the state, advertises there, has dealership networks there, or makes other deliberate efforts, itself, to market its goods in the state of ultimate sale to the consumer. Justice Brennan\u2019s concurring opinion in Asahi, however, appeared to accept the principle that sales of large quantities of the defendant\u2019s product in an American state, even indirectly through the stream of commerce, would support jurisdiction in that state, if the plaintiff suffered injury there from the product. Justice Stevens, while finding it unnecessary to reach the minimum contacts question, also appeared inclined to find jurisdiction based on indirect sales in a state, depending on the nature and quantity of those sales. However, while the Justices could not agree on what constitutes \u2018\u2018purposeful availment\u2019\u2019 in a stream- of-commerce case, eight did agree that, even if minimum contacts existed, it would be unreasonable on the facts of the case for the California court to exercise jurisdiction over Asahi, since the dispute remaining after the plaintiff settled was a claim for indemnification between two Asian corporations. We Civil Procedure wonks waited long and anxiously\u2014for twenty- four years\u2014for the Court to clarify this vexing problem. Finally the Court took certiorari in J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873 (2011), and we looked forward to further wisdom on stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Alas, fooled again. The case involved a machine made in England, imported to a distributor in Ohio, and resold into New Jersey. Nicastro was injured there using the machine and brought suit against the English manufacturer in New Jersey. It argued, predictably, that it was not subject to personal jurisdiction for this claim in New Jersey, since it had done nothing in New Jersey at all; it had just made machines in England and sold them to a distributor in Ohio. In Nicastro the Court again split badly on the reach of stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Justice Kennedy\u2019s plurality opinion, joined by three other justices, concluded that J. McIntyre had not \u2018\u2018engaged in conduct purposely directed to New Jersey\u2019\u2019 (564 U.S. at 886) and therefore could not be sued in New Jersey for Nicastro\u2019s claim. Two justices filed a concurring opinion saying, essentially, \u2018\u2018no jurisdiction on these facts but we might rule differently if there were a regular course of sales into New Jersey, or deliberate efforts to cultivate the New Jersey market.\u2019\u2019 And three dissenters argued, vociferously, that J. McIntyre had sought to cultivate the United States market, had succeeded in doing so, and ought to defend the product in a state where it was resold to the ultimate user and caused injury. So, neither Asahi nor McIntyre provides clear guidance on the stream-of-commerce problem. There will be a lot of unclear cases, and expensive litigation of the jurisdiction issue in such cases will continue. Perhaps this is inevitable; perhaps the Justices have not given us a clear answer because there never can be one for a problem with so many possible variations. But the following questions may help you to at least define the parameters of the problem.\n\nQuestion:\n9. Between two extremes. Atlanta Precision Drill Corporation makes drill presses in Georgia. It sells them to several wholesale distributors, including Emporia Distributors in Pennsylvania. It sells about five hundred drill presses a year to Emporia.

Although it will be inconvenient for Mary to litigate in California, she did choose to go there and caused the accident there (allegedly). A procedure that requires her to defend her California conduct in a California court hardly reflects a lack of due process under the International Shoe line of cases.

Neff to Shaffer v. Heitner, attachment jurisdiction was widely invoked to support jurisdiction over unrelated claims. It was routinely used, for example, to attach intangible assets, such as bank deposits. This expanded the doctrine beyond its traditional roots, which involved physical control of physical assets. It is harder to think of a bank account, which is a contractual right to repayment of the deposited amount, as physically \u2018\u2018present\u2019\u2019 in a particular place. Harris v. Balk, 198 U.S. 215 (1905), was an extreme example of the use of attachment jurisdiction to seize an intangible asset. In Harris, Epstein, a Maryland citizen with a claim against Balk, learned that Harris, who owed money to Balk, was coming to Maryland. Epstein sued Balk in Maryland, and obtained a writ of attachment for the seizure of Harris\u2019s debt to Balk. He then served the writ on Harris while he was in Maryland. The Supreme Court concluded that Harris\u2019s debt to Balk traveled with him, so that it could be \u2018\u2018seized\u2019\u2019 in Maryland while Harris was there, and disposed of by order of the Maryland court. This was an exercise of attachment, or quasi in rem type II jurisdiction, because Harris\u2019s debt to Balk was completely unrelated to Epstein\u2019s claim against Balk. It simply provided an unrelated asset that could be seized by the court and used to satisfy Epstein\u2019s claim. Shaffer involved a similarly extreme exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction. Heitner sued officers and directors of Greyhound Company in Delaware, asserting a claim arising out of alleged mismanagement of the company\u2019s business in Oregon. Many of the defendants had not acted in Delaware, and had no other connection to Delaware that would support personal jurisdiction over them there. But many of them owned Greyhound stock. And Delaware had a statute that declared all shares of stock in Delaware corporations to be present in Delaware. Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8, \u00a7169 (1975). So, Heitner sought\u2014and was granted\u2014a court order seizing (\u2018\u2018sequestering\u2019\u2019) the Greyhound stock owned by the defendants. Here, as in Harris v. Balk, Heitner did not claim any preexisting ownership interest in the stock itself. Rather, he sought to adjudicate an unrelated claim that arose in Oregon based on the court\u2019s seizure of these intangible assets. Like the plaintiff\u2019s ploy in Harris, this was an exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction\u2014very type II. In Shaffer, the Court held that the artificial distinction between exercising jurisdiction over the defendant and exercising jurisdiction over his property in quasi in rem type II cases \u2018\u2018supports an ancient form without substantial modern justification.\u2019\u2019 433 U.S. at 212. Because taking the defendants\u2019 property was merely an \u2018\u2018elliptical way\u2019\u2019 of asserting jurisdiction over the defendants themselves, the Court broadly concluded that it could only be asserted under the same standards: \u2018\u2018We therefore conclude that all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in International Shoe and its progeny.\u2019\u2019 433 U.S. at 212. If this broad language from Shaffer means what it says, it would allow the assertion of attachment jurisdiction only when the defendant could personally be sued in the state for the underlying claim, under in personam jurisdiction standards. For the moment, let\u2019s take the broad holding quoted above at face value. On that assumption, consider the following example.\n\nQuestion:\n6. Shaffer survivors? In which of the following cases could the court properly assert jurisdiction, after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Shaffer v. Heitner?\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nOhora is injured when she falls in a hole while crossing the lawn in front of Roux\u2019s summer house in Nebraska. She sues Roux in Nebraska for her injuries and asserts jurisdiction by obtaining a writ of attachment on the property on which she was injured.\n\nAnalysis:\nIn his majority opinion, Justice Marshall suggested that exercises of in rem jurisdiction would have to be measured by the same standards as exercises of in personam jurisdiction. Thus, attachment jurisdiction is not dead. It is constitutionally permissible for a court to exercise jurisdiction based on an attachment . . . if it could assert jurisdiction over the defendant personally for the claim plaintiff seeks to adjudicate. So, to decide whether the above in rem cases are still permissible, we must ask whether the plaintiff could have sued the defendant for the same claim in an in personam action. In A, the plaintiff was injured on the defendant\u2019s property and seeks to recover for the injury. This claim arises out of the ownership and maintenance of real property in the state. Since it arises from a significant in-state contact of Roux in Nebraska\u2014maintenance of his property there\u2014he could be sued for it in Nebraska based on specific in personam jurisdiction. Thus, this exercise of jurisdiction meets International Shoe jurisdictional standards, and Ohora may proceed by attaching the property under an attachment statute if she chooses to do so. In Shaffer, Justice Marshall notes that the minimum contacts test will usually be met in such cases. See 433 U.S. at 208. One might legitimately wonder why Ohora would choose to proceed by attachment, which only brings the defendant\u2019s property before the court, rather than suing Roux in personam, which would support a personal judgment for the full amount of Ohora\u2019s injuries. Presumably, Ohora would sue in personam in most cases. She might proceed by attachment, however, if the state long-arm statute did not authorize personal jurisdiction under the circumstances, yet the attachment statute authorized attachment of the defendant\u2019s in-state assets. For an example of such a case, see Intermeat Inc. v. American Poultry Inc., 575 F.2d 1017 (2d Cir. 1978). \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nOver the years from Pennoyer v. Neff to Shaffer v.

Balk, 198 U.S. 215 (1905), was an extreme example of the use of attachment jurisdiction to seize an intangible asset. In Harris, Epstein, a Maryland citizen with a claim against Balk, learned that Harris, who owed money to Balk, was coming to Maryland. Epstein sued Balk in Maryland, and obtained a writ of attachment for the seizure of Harris\u2019s debt to Balk. He then served the writ on Harris while he was in Maryland. The Supreme Court concluded that Harris\u2019s debt to Balk traveled with him, so that it could be \u2018\u2018seized\u2019\u2019 in Maryland while Harris was there, and disposed of by order of the Maryland court. This was an exercise of attachment, or quasi in rem type II jurisdiction, because Harris\u2019s debt to Balk was completely unrelated to Epstein\u2019s claim against Balk. It simply provided an unrelated asset that could be seized by the court and used to satisfy Epstein\u2019s claim. Shaffer involved a similarly extreme exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction. Heitner sued officers and directors of Greyhound Company in Delaware, asserting a claim arising out of alleged mismanagement of the company\u2019s business in Oregon. Many of the defendants had not acted in Delaware, and had no other connection to Delaware that would support personal jurisdiction over them there. But many of them owned Greyhound stock. And Delaware had a statute that declared all shares of stock in Delaware corporations to be present in Delaware. Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8, \u00a7169 (1975). So, Heitner sought\u2014and was granted\u2014a court order seizing (\u2018\u2018sequestering\u2019\u2019) the Greyhound stock owned by the defendants. Here, as in Harris v. Balk, Heitner did not claim any preexisting ownership interest in the stock itself. Rather, he sought to adjudicate an unrelated claim that arose in Oregon based on the court\u2019s seizure of these intangible assets. Like the plaintiff\u2019s ploy in Harris, this was an exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction\u2014very type II. In Shaffer, the Court held that the artificial distinction between exercising jurisdiction over the defendant and exercising jurisdiction over his property in quasi in rem type II cases \u2018\u2018supports an ancient form without substantial modern justification.\u2019\u2019 433 U.S. at 212. Because taking the defendants\u2019 property was merely an \u2018\u2018elliptical way\u2019\u2019 of asserting jurisdiction over the defendants themselves, the Court broadly concluded that it could only be asserted under the same standards: \u2018\u2018We therefore conclude that all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in International Shoe and its progeny.\u2019\u2019 433 U.S. at 212. If this broad language from Shaffer means what it says, it would allow the assertion of attachment jurisdiction only when the defendant could personally be sued in the state for the underlying claim, under in personam jurisdiction standards.

In which of the following cases could the court properly assert jurisdiction, after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Shaffer v. Heitner?\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nOhora brings an action to quiet title to her Nebraska farm in a Nebraska court. She gives notice of the action by mail to Roux, who lives in New York but claims a one-third interest in the farm inherited from a great aunt. She also gives notice by publication to unknown claimants to the property.\n\nAnalysis:\nB is a \u2018\u2018pure\u2019\u2019 in rem action to quiet title to real property. Under the broad holding of the Shaffer majority, such actions would have to meet the personal jurisdiction standards of International Shoe. And they usually would, since the suit involves title to property within the forum state. Because it arises from ownership of an interest in land in Nebraska, claimants to the property will have a minimum contact in Nebraska that gives rise to the claim. Since the court could proceed in personam, it may proceed based on jurisdiction over the property instead. This one is OK. The trend seems pretty clear here, doesn\u2019t it. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nOver the years from Pennoyer v. Neff to Shaffer v.

Thus, it\u2019s important to understand the limits on their power to force defendants to defend in a particular district as well. The constitutional limits on a state court\u2019s power to exercise jurisdiction are rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which provides, \u2018\u2018nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law\u2019\u2019 (emphasis supplied). The Fourteenth Amendment applies to the states; it does not apply to the federal government. The Fifth Amendment contains a similar due process clause that does apply to the federal government and its courts. However, it has been interpreted somewhat differently from the Fourteenth. Generally, the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause has been held to allow a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant if she has an appropriate relation to the United States as a whole, not to a particular state.

But in many cases the defendant already knows that suit is being filed or can easily be given notice without the formality of service under the Federal Rules. So Rule 4 provides a method for a defendant to waive compliance with formal service requirements. Rule 4(d) authorizes a plaintiff to send the defendant a notice of the action and request that she waive service of process. A request for waiver must be addressed to the defendant (or, for a corporate defendant, an appropriate officer or managing agent or other agent authorized to receive process), and provide the name of the court in which the suit is pending, a copy of the complaint, two copies of the waiver form, and a stamped envelope to send it back. It must inform the defendant of the consequences of waiving service and of not waiving it, state the date of the request, give at least 30 days to return the waiver, and be sent by \u2018\u2018first-class mail or other reliable means.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1). Rule 4(d)(1) provides that the defendant has a duty to avoid unnecessary costs of service, and Rule 4(d)(2) tells her what will happen if she fails to fulfill that duty: She will have to pay the costs of formal service and any motion necessary to collect those costs. That isn\u2019t too scary, because the cost of service is not going to break the bank. But the rule makers cleverly provided a carrot as well as a stick: Rule 4(d)(3) provides that a defendant who waives formal service gets 60 days to file an answer, rather than the usual 21. For busy lawyers, that\u2019s a real incentive. So waiver is a genteel alternative to formal service and will frequently happen, but not always. Rule 4(d) does not expressly tell us what a plaintiff should do if the defendant does not waive service.

Tompkins\u2019s accident took place in Pennsylvania, but he brought suit against the railroad in New York. Erie clearly requires the federal court to apply state law to his claim, but which state\u2019s law, Pennsylvania\u2019s\u2014where the accident happened\u2014or New York\u2019s, where the case was filed? Because the case has connections with both states, each would have a basis for applying its own law to it. How is the federal court to choose between the two bodies of state tort law? Every state has \u2018\u2018choice-of-law\u2019\u2019 rules to deal with this problem, which arises frequently in state cases as well as federal diversity cases. For example, for many years the states used the \u2018\u2018lex loci delicti\u2019\u2019 choice-of-law rule in tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of injury, even if the suit were filed in a different state. Similarly, in contracts cases, traditional choice-of-law doctrine looked to the contract law of the place where the contract was formed. After Erie established that federal diversity courts had to apply state law, federal courts faced the further problem of choosing which state\u2019s law to use in a case like Erie. Should federal courts develop their own \u2018\u2018choice-of-law\u2019\u2019 rules for diversity cases, or borrow from the states? Three years after Erie, the Supreme Court addressed this issue in Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941). Klaxon held that a federal diversity court should use the choice-of-law rules of the state in which it sits. Thus, a New York federal court should apply whatever state substantive law the New York state court would apply to the case. If a New York court, under its choice-of-law rules, would apply New York tort law to Tompkins\u2019s accident (even though it took place in Pennsylvania), the New York federal court should do so as well. On the other hand, if a New York court would, under its choice-of-law rule for torts, apply Pennsylvania law to Tompkins\u2019s case, the New York federal court should similarly look to Pennsylvania law. Klaxon reasoned that Erie required that the case come out the same way in federal court that it would in the state courts of the state where the federal court sat. To further that uniformity goal, the federal court should choose whatever body of tort law (or contract law or other state law) the local state court would. When Erie was decided, most courts applied the lex loci delicti choice of law rule to tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of the injury. Under the lex loci rule, there was little doubt that, if a New York state court heard Tompkins\u2019s case, it would apply Pennsylvania tort law to it. So a federal court in New York would also look to Pennsylvania tort law to decide the case. Today, however, states use widely divergent choice-of-law rules. One state might use the place-of-the-injury rule in a tort case, another might look to the interests of the various states connected to the case, and another state might apply its own law as long as the case has some connection to it. It is entirely possible, under this balkanized approach to choice of law, that a New York court would apply New York law to a case, even though, had the case been filed in Pennsylvania, that court would have chosen its law\u2014or that of a third state\u2014to govern the same case. Since New York courts and Pennsylvania courts might apply different bodies of tort law to a case, it follows, under Klaxon, that federal courts in those states might also end up applying different tort rules to the same dispute. If the New York federal court uses New York\u2019s choice of law rules to select the proper tort law (as it must under Klaxon), it might select New York law in a case like Tompkins\u2019s, because a New York state court would, under its choice-of-law rules. But, if Pennsylvania uses different choice of law rules, a Pennsylvania federal court using Pennsylvania choice of law rules might apply Pennsylvania law, if Tompkins sued there. So Tompkins\u2019s lawyers might find, even now, that by selecting a federal court in one state rather than another, they can still shop for more favorable law, since the federal court in each state will use local choice-of-law rules to select the applicable substantive law. The Klaxon Court recognized that its holding posed this risk, but shrugged it off as inevitable: Whatever lack of uniformity this may produce between federal courts in different states is attributable to our federal system, which leaves to a state, within the limits permitted by the Constitution, the right to pursue local policies diverging from those of its neighbors. 313 U.S. at 496. So, the bottom line is that a federal diversity court must apply whatever state law the courts of the state in which it sits would apply. In cases with connections to more than one state, this adds a second layer to the Erie analysis.\n\nQuestion:\n8. Your law or mine? Whitney, a Rhode Island citizen, goes skiing at a ski area in Vermont. When he purchases his lift ticket, he quickly signs a release of liability, waiving his right to sue, should he be injured due to negligence of the operator. While coming down an expert trail, he comes suddenly upon a bare spot full of rocks. He falls and is injured. He brings a diversity action against the operator in federal court in Rhode Island, basing personal jurisdiction on the fact that it had sent him an offer there for a weekend ski package that induced him to go to Vermont to ski. Assume that Rhode Island tort law refuses to enforce advance waivers of liability for negligence, unless they were individually negotiated. Assume further that Vermont tort law holds such waivers enforceable. Assume further that Rhode Island\u2019s choice-of-law rule for tort cases is to apply the law of the place of the injury, while Vermont\u2019s choice-of-law rule involves an assessment of the interests of the parties and states involved. It is less predictable under this balancing approach to choice of law whether the court would apply Rhode Island or Vermont law. The Rhode Island federal district judge would probably apply\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nVermont law to Whitney\u2019s case, because the accident happened in Vermont.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nIn Hanna, the Court addressed the power of Congress to promulgate rules that govern procedure in the federal courts. See 380 U.S. at 464. Analytically, it had to do so, because the power to write the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is granted by Congress to the Court, in the Rules Enabling Act. Surely, Congress could not delegate to the Court any broader rule-making power than it possesses itself. In Hanna, the Court describes Congress\u2019s rule-making authority as follows: the constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. That\u2019s a mighty broad test for Congressional power over federal court procedure: If the provision can rationally be viewed as regulating procedure, Congress may enact it, even if it will affect the outcome of litigation.

See 380 U.S. at 464. Analytically, it had to do so, because the power to write the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is granted by Congress to the Court, in the Rules Enabling Act. Surely, Congress could not delegate to the Court any broader rule-making power than it possesses itself. In Hanna, the Court describes Congress\u2019s rule-making authority as follows: the constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. That\u2019s a mighty broad test for Congressional power over federal court procedure: If the provision can rationally be viewed as regulating procedure, Congress may enact it, even if it will affect the outcome of litigation.

The York/Hanna doctrine is hard. So the Closer here is just another Closer. Consider again the two prongs of the Hanna analysis in choosing the best answer.  That is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer. But Hanna changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In Hanna, Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule. York and Byrd both involved such conflicts. York involved a conflict between a state statute and the judicial practice of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And Byrd involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal judicial practice of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these \u2018\u2018relatively unguided\u2019\u2019 Erie conflicts, Hanna reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in Byrd\u2019s language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because \u2018\u2018there can be no other law.\u2019\u2019 Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury\u2019s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy Erie sought to further\u2014uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts\u2014but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the Hanna opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of York\u2019s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are not prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and \u2018\u2018inequitable administration of the laws,\u2019\u2019 that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York line of cases would not require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following Question 1.) That\u2019s Hanna Part I. It\u2019s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in Hanna, unlike in York or in Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna construed Congress\u2019s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is \u2018\u2018rationally capable of classification\u2019\u2019 as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the \u2018\u2018outcome-determinative\u2019\u2019 test of York, or the more refined outcome-determinative test of Hanna Part I. But the rule involved in Hanna wasn\u2019t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to \u2018\u2018prescribe general rules of practice and procedure\u2019\u2019 for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a). In Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress\u2019s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted \u00a72072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that \u2018\u2018really regulates procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\u2019\u2019 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress\u2019s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress\u2019s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court\u2019s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b) provides that the Rules \u2018\u2018shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u2019\u2019 Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, \u00a72072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \u00a72072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and\u2014even if it is\u2014it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the \u2018\u2018modified outcome-determinative test\u2019\u2019 of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the \u2018\u2018Supreme Law of the Land.\u2019\u2019 United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under Hanna Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under Hanna Part II? \n\nQuestion:\n7. A matter of procedure? Columbus sues Moriarty in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Her claim is for an injury she suffered in Tennessee, when she was hit by a bullet fired by one of a group of hunters. Her injuries are grievous, so her damages evidence will be graphic and moving. There is a significant question in the case as to whether it was Moriarty who shot her. Moriarty moves to bifurcate the trial, that is, to try the issue of whether his bullet hit Columbus first\u2014and have the jury decide it\u2014before trying the damages issues. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) authorizes federal courts to order a separate trial of one or more issues \u2018\u2018in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice.\u2019\u2019 However, Tennessee has a state constitutional provision that has been interpreted to require a single, unified trial of all the issues in a suit. The federal judge grants the motion for a separate trial, and the jury finds that it was not Moriarty\u2019s bullet that hit Columbus. Judgment therefore enters for Moriarty. Columbus appeals, arguing that the court should have applied the state unified-trial approach. The Court of Appeals should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\naffirm the judgment, because Moriarty might have won in a unitary trial as well, so the Rule 42(b) decision to bifurcate is not outcome-determinative.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nLet\u2019s consider the joinder question from the point of view of the third- party defendant.

Curtiss, 7 U.S. 267 (1806). In 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(b), Congress sought to preserve the Kroger limit on supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases. Section 1367(b). In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332. This provision is the source of most student confusion concerning supplemental jurisdiction. Basically, it provides that in diversity cases only, the federal court will not have supplemental jurisdiction over certain claims by plaintiffs or persons sought to be joined as plaintiffs. Not all claims, just some claims, defined in \u00a71367(b) by reference to the rules used to join them. The purpose for this exception to the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \u00a71367(a) is to prevent parties from evading the Strawbridge complete diversity rule. Under that rule, a plaintiff in a diversity case can\u2019t sue defendants from her own state. If she could achieve the same result by suing a diverse defendant and then using supplemental jurisdiction to add a claim against one who is not diverse, Strawbridge would be a dead letter. Some think it should be a dead letter, but Congress evidently doesn\u2019t. So \u00a71367(b) enumerates certain situations in which a plaintiff in a diversity case cannot rely on supplemental jurisdiction to assert additional claims, even if they arise out of the same case or controversy under \u00a71367(a). Section 1367(b) isn\u2019t too bad if you approach it in steps. \u2022 First, ask if jurisdiction over the main claim is based solely on diversity. If it isn\u2019t, stop!

If so, supplemental jurisdiction is barred. \u2022 Or, if the case involves Rule 19 or Rule 24, consider whether the person would be joined as a plaintiff under Rule 19 or intervene as a plaintiff under Rule 24. If so, \u00a71367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. \u2022 Last, just to be thorough, ask whether there is a basis for original jurisdiction over the added claim. If there is, the claim should be fine even though it is one of the claims described in \u00a71367(b). If the claim could have been asserted in federal court on its own, there is no need for supplemental jurisdiction. For example, if Luis, a plaintiff from Maine, asserts a claim against DeVoto (a third-party defendant in the case who is also from Maine) under a federal statute, who cares that there\u2019s no diversity, and who cares that \u00a71367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. This is a case that Luis could have asserted in federal court in a stand-alone suit, so the court has jurisdiction over it without regard to supplemental jurisdiction. An example should help.

He sues in federal court, claiming that Pariah fired him based on his age, seeking $50,000 in damages. Pariah impleads Newcomb, a former supervisor who allegedly made the actual decision to fire Cavers. It seeks indemnification from Newcomb, an Iowa citizen, for her illegal act. After Newcomb is brought in under Rule 14(a), Cavers asserts a claim directly against Newcomb, alleging tortious interference with the contract, a state law claim, against him and seeking the same damages. Newcomb moves to dismiss Cavers\u2019s claim against her for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe court has supplemental jurisdiction over the claim under \u00a71367(a), and \u00a71367(b) does not bar the court from hearing the claim.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nBefore the supplemental jurisdiction statute was enacted, the case law had held that in a diversity case, each plaintiff had to meet the amount in controversy requirement independently against each defendant. Suppose that Currier and Ives were injured in an accident, and sued Hochstein. If Currier\u2019s damages were $120,000, and Ives\u2019s were $25,000, Currier would satisfy the amount in controversy requirement in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a)(1), but Ives would not. Ives could not add his damages together with Currier\u2019s, and argue the case was for $145,000: he had to assert a claim himself for more than $75,000. Similarly, if a plaintiff sued multiple defendants, she had to assert a colorable claim for more than $75,000 against each defendant. Suppose Currier sued Hochstein for $60,000 in business losses, and claimed that he was entitled to double damages under an unfair business practices statute. He might recover a total of $120,000 on these claims, so he met the amount requirement. Now suppose that Currier made Faust a second defendant, seeking recovery of the same business losses, but the double damages statute did not apply to Faust. Because Currier only had a $60,000 claim against Faust, he did not satisfy the amount requirement against her. Again, he had to meet the amount in controversy requirement separately against each defendant. When Congress enacted the supplemental jurisdiction statute, it probably did not intend to change either of those rules. However, the text of \u00a71367 appears to change one of them. The question below illustrates the problem, which the Supreme Court addressed at length in Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, 545 U.S. 546 (2005). In analyzing the problem, focus ruthlessly on the language of the statute.\n\nQuestion:\n8. Supplementing supplemental jurisdiction. Cavers, from Wisconsin, sues Pariah Corporation, an Iowa corporation with its principal place of business in Iowa, for damages for breach of contract, after he is fired by Pariah on the ground that he, along with Westford, had embezzled funds from Pariah. Cavers sues in federal court, for $100,000, based on diversity jurisdiction. Westford, another Wisconsin citizen, was also fired for the embezzlement, and joins as a coplaintiff in the suit, seeking $40,000 in damages. Under the language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367 in the suit, the court would\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nhave jurisdiction over Westford\u2019s claim under \u00a71367(a), but it is barred by \u00a71367(b).\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nRule 8 contains simple, sensible provisions governing the defendant\u2019s responses to the allegations in the complaint. First, Rule 8(b) requires the defendant to admit or deny each of the allegations in the complaint. Usually, this is done paragraph by paragraph. Rule 10(b) requires that averments in the complaint be set forth in separate paragraphs. The defendant, in answering, must take a position on each of these allegations, by admitting those that are true, and denying those that aren\u2019t. Under Rule 8(b)(2), a \u2018\u2018denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.\u2019\u2019 If the defendant means to deny only a part of an allegation, she must specify what is true and deny only the parts that are not. Failing to deny an allegation constitutes an admission of it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6). The idea is that, if the parties plead conscientiously by the Rules, the parties and the court can compare the allegations in the complaint and the responses in the answer, and determine which issues are contested and which are agreed upon (and therefore need not be litigated). If all goes right, this simple pleading process can narrow the scope of the dispute considerably. The Rule also recognizes that the defendant may not know whether some allegations in the complaint are true or not. If she has grounds to deny them, she may do so, but if she just doesn\u2019t know, or doesn\u2019t have the information necessary to admit or deny at the time of pleading, she may respond that she \u2018\u2018lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation.\u2019\u2019 Fed.

Patterson sues Applied Electronics, Inc., for injuries suffered in an accident with Adair, one of AE\u2019s delivery drivers. Patterson alleges in Paragraph 4 of his complaint that Adair was an employee of AE at the time of the accident, that Adair was acting in the scope of employment at the time of the accident (which Patterson must prove in order to recover from the employer), that Adair was talking on his cell phone at the time of the accident, and that Adair\u2019s negligent driving caused the accident. AE answers Paragraph 4 as follows: \u2018\u2018The defendant admits that Adair was its employee at the time of the accident, denies that Adair was negligent, but is without sufficient information to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation that Adair was talking on his cell phone at the time of the accident.\u2019\u2019 Under Federal Rule 8,\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nAE has admitted that Adair was its employee, but not that he acted in the scope of employment.

The idea is to put the defendant on notice of the positions that you may seek to establish, not a single one you have settled on irrevocably. The same goes for the defendant. Under Rule 8, the defendant is allowed to plead whatever defenses she has to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. She may take inconsistent positions about the facts or the law, and may raise multiple defenses without choosing among them. The defendant might, for example, deny that she was negligent, but also allege that the plaintiff was more negligent than she was and is therefore barred from recovery. She might deny that she had a contract with the plaintiff, raise as a second defense that she did not breach, and raise as a third defense that the statute of limitations bars recovery. Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn\u2019t required to stake her case on one of them. Although Rule 11(b)(3) requires support for affirmative defenses as well as factual allegations in the original complaint, it is unfortunately common for defendants to \u2018\u2018overplead\u2019\u2019 affirmative defenses.

Doubtless, counsel view the risk of sanctions for overpleading defenses as less grievous than the risk of waiving a defense by failing to assert it.

So we have a pre-closer and a closer. A party who sues a defendant on a claim within the limitations period may change theories, add new damages, or recast the factual basis of the claim through amendments, assuming that the amended allegations still are based on the same underlying facts, and that the judge allows the amendment. The amended allegations will \u2018\u2018relate back\u2019\u2019 to the date the original complaint was filed. If the claim asserted in the amended complaint would have been timely on that date, Rule 15(c)(1)(B) avoids any limitations problem. But suppose the amendment adds a new defendant to the case? Rule 15 has a separate, more abstruse provision, Rule 15(c)(1)(C), that deals with this twist. As an example, assume that Leroy sues Tele-Sell, a telemarketing firm, under a statute barring telemarketing calls to consumers who have placed their names on a state do-not-call list. After he sues, the limitations period passes. Several months later, he learns that he was mistaken, that the calls actually came from Tel-Connect, a different firm. Consequently, he moves to amend to substitute Tel- Connect as the defendant. Allowing relation back for an amendment like this, adding a new party, requires a more stringent standard than others, because the new claim is against a different defendant, who was not sued before the limitations period expired.

This notice must have been received within the period of time it would have been received had the new defendant been sued originally. \u2022 Third, the plaintiff must show that the new defendant brought in by the amendment \u2018\u2018knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The first requirement is met in Leroy\u2019s case. He is suing Tel-Connect for the same harassing calls that were the basis of his initial suit against Tele-Sell.

Allowing relation back for an amendment like this, adding a new party, requires a more stringent standard than others, because the new claim is against a different defendant, who was not sued before the limitations period expired. Under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) three requirements must be met before an amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted will \u2018\u2018relate back\u2019\u2019 to the date the original complaint was filed. \u2022 First, the amended pleading must arise out of the same events as the original pleading. Rule 15(c)(1)(C). \u2022 Second, the defendant being added must have \u2018\u2018received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). This notice must have been received within the period of time it would have been received had the new defendant been sued originally. \u2022 Third, the plaintiff must show that the new defendant brought in by the amendment \u2018\u2018knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The first requirement is met in Leroy\u2019s case. He is suing Tel-Connect for the same harassing calls that were the basis of his initial suit against Tele-Sell. But Rule 15(c)(1) requires more than that. It also requires that Tel-Connect was aware, within the period for suing and serving the complaint on Tele-Sell, that the suit had been brought, and that it\u2014Tel- Connect\u2014was actually the intended target of the suit. What\u2019s the point of this complex provision? It is meant to ensure that Tel-Connect, the party Leroy brings in late, had actual notice within the limitations period (plus the additional 90 days that Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) gives for serving the complaint2) that Leroy intended to sue it. If it had such notice, the purpose of the limitations period has been satisfied: The added defendant was aware of the need to preserve evidence and prepare a defense, within the limitations period prescribed by the legislature. Perhaps the following question will help to sort out the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C).\n\nQuestion:\n7. Black and White. Williams is roughed up during an arrest by a police officer and suffers a broken wrist that doesn\u2019t heal right. Williams consults Darrow, a lawyer, who brings a federal civil rights action for his injury. Darrow obtains the police report of the arrest, which lists Officer Black as the arresting officer. Darrow names Black as the defendant. Suit is filed one month before the limitations period runs. In fact, it wasn\u2019t Black who arrested Williams, it was Officer White. The report, filled out by the booking officer, was simply mistaken. Within a few days, every officer in the precinct, including White, became aware that Black had been sued by an arrestee for excessive force, though they were not aware of the specific circumstances of the case or the identity of the plaintiff. Six months later, Black answers interrogatories sent to him by Williams, denying that he was the arresting officer. Darrow investigates, confirms from other witnesses that White was the arresting officer, and moves to amend to name White as the defendant in the action. The amendment, if allowed, will likely\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nrelate back, because it arises out of the same arrest alleged in the initial complaint.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nRule 11(c)(2) is often referred to as the \u2018\u2018safe harbor\u2019\u2019 provision of Rule 11. This subsection is intended to limit court time spent on sanctions motions while at the same time providing an incentive to clean up dubious pleadings and other filings. Under Rule 11(c)(2) a party who concludes that allegations in an opponent\u2019s filing are sanctionable may draft a motion for sanctions, citing the offending allegations. However, the moving party does not file the motion with the court; she sends it (presumably, with a supporting memorandum explaining why the challenged allegations are sanctionable) to the offending party. The rule gives the offender 21 days to withdraw or correct the challenged items. If she does, that\u2019s the end of it; the offender has sailed into the safe harbor; the moving party will not file the motion and the court will not impose a sanction. If the offender does not correct or withdraw, then the party who sent the motion files it with the court, which will hear the motion and may not only impose a sanction for submitting the unsupported paper, but may also award the moving party expenses and fees for the motion. The logic of Rule 11(c)(2) is impeccable: Put the party on notice of the unwarranted allegations, let her clean it up or withdraw it, and get on with the real issues in the case without taking the court\u2019s time culling out the frivolous ones. One wonders, however, if the practice matches the theory. How often will a litigator, who after all drafted and submitted the paper, roll over and cry \u2018\u2018mea culpa!\u2019\u2019 when an unloved opponent brands her a rule breaker? It may be that many litigators, who tend to be a feisty lot, will succumb to the temptation to dig in their heels rather than recognize the error of their ways. This would be unfortunate, but one suspects that the aggressive litigator does not always resemble Judge Hand\u2019s Reasonable Person. Here\u2019s an interesting question on the point.\n\nQuestion:\n6. The unsafe harbor. Withers sues Rendoso in federal court in East Dakota for negligent indirect infliction of emotional distress, claiming that he suffered severe distress from witnessing an accident in which a friend was seriously injured. Rendoso moves to dismiss the claim under Rule 12(b) (6) for failure to state a claim, citing two recent cases from the East Dakota Supreme Court that quite clearly limit the right to recover for indirect infliction to close family members. The court enters an order dismissing the claim. Rendoso now moves for sanctions under Rule 11(b)(2), on the ground that the legal position taken in Withers\u2019s complaint was frivolous. The court will likely\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ndeny the motion, because the court can only impose sanctions if the paper was challenged under the Rule 11(c)(2) procedure.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nThere\u2019s a lot more to Rule 11 than we have covered so far. Let\u2019s round out the discussion with a Closer that\u2014if you want to nail it\u2014will force you do something many of my students resist to the teeth\u2014to actually read the rule. The answers to this Closer are all tucked in there somewhere. Think of it as a litigator\u2019s treasure hunt.  The previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments. They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important question: What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).)  Consider the dilemma for the drafters of Rule 11 when establishing ethical limits on asserting legal positions before the court. Surely, they don\u2019t want to prevent lawyers from arguing for legal positions that have not been recognized before. Then the law could never change, because lawyers would be subject to sanctions for arguing for change. Surely, the rule makers also would not want to bar lawyers from arguing for the overruling of established law, for the same reason. But they do want to rein in extravagant or outlandish legal arguments that waste the courts\u2019 time. Rule 11(b) walks this line by requiring that there be a \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous argument\u2019\u2019 for legal positions that are not currently recognized or would require the court to overrule current law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), an advocate certifies to the court that the legal positions taken in a pleading, motion or other paper are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), the party asserting a legal position must have a rational argument for the position asserted, a position that has not been definitively rejected by the courts of the jurisdiction so recently that nothing but obstinacy would lead a lawyer to try again. Such \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous\u2019\u2019 arguments might be based on precedents from other states, dissenting opinions, changes by the appellate courts of the relevant state in related areas of law, scholarly criticism of the current law, or other authority suggesting that change is warranted. If you are going to file a pleading, motion, or other paper that argues for a change in the law, but don\u2019t want to risk Rule 11 sanctions, think of it this way: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going out on a limb here. My position is contradicted by the cases. If the judge calls me in before the bench and asks why I should not be sanctioned for violating Rule 11(b)(2), what will I say?\u2019\u2019 You need to be ready with a credible explanation why your argument for change is justified by precedent or other authority. You might say, \u2018\u2018Yes, your honor, I know that I\u2019m arguing to overrule Flores v. Jones, the case on point from our state supreme court, but the Third Restatement of Torts now takes the position I advocate, and four states have recently adopted it.\u2019\u2019 Or, \u2018\u2018Yes, your Honor, I know our state supreme court ruled otherwise in 1934, but look at how many areas of tort law they have modified since. Recognizing this cause of action is supported by our court\u2019s consistent expansion of tort remedies for negligence, reflected in the following seven cases.\u2019\u2019 Arguments like those are \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous.\u2019\u2019 The advocate is not just saying, \u2018\u2018I think the law should be otherwise,\u2019\u2019 but pointing to legal authority that supports the argument. This is reasoned persuasive argument rather than stubborn refusal to face the music. Courts should not prevent that, and Rule 11(b) (2) does not either. Consider this question on the point.  Rule 11 also imposes constraints on the factual allegations made in a pleading or motion. Under Rule 11(b)(3), the party making factual allegations certifies that \u2018\u2018after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,\u2019\u2019 those allegations \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\u2019\u2019 The basic standard, that the factual contentions \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support,\u2019\u2019 mandates that counsel have looked into the facts and have credible evidence in support of each fact alleged in her court filings. This standard clearly does not require that the evidence available at the time of filing the paper clearly establishes the fact alleged, or even makes it more probable than not that the fact is true. It requires that counsel have looked into the matter, and after doing so has some preliminary evidence in support of the allegation. That\u2019s a pretty indulgent standard, yet it does bar the tempting practice of filing papers without evidence and then casting about to find some later down the line. That is a temptation to busy counsel that Rule 11(b)(3) is meant to discourage. Consider this example. To nail it, take a look at Rule 11(c)(1) as well as Rule 11(b). \n\nQuestion:\n7.

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). That\u2019s understandable. In studying personal jurisdiction, we read common law cases in which the defendant \u2018\u2018appears specially\u2019\u2019 to object to jurisdiction. Then we study pleadings and motions under the Federal Rules, and along comes a different approach to jurisdictional objections. It\u2019s easy enough to mix them up. The special appearance was the common law\u2019s rather formalistic approach to raising objections to personal jurisdiction. A defendant who claimed that the court in which suit was filed lacked jurisdiction over her would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 to contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The defendant making a special appearance had to do so before answering the complaint on the merits, and she had to confine her argument to the lack of jurisdiction. If she raised any other issue, the court would hold that she had entered a \u2018\u2018general appearance\u2019\u2019 by litigating issues other than jurisdiction. Any reference to the merits, or even to other types of preliminary objections, could lead the court to conclude that, by appearing to litigate other issues, the defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and waived her objection to personal jurisdiction. In the federal courts, and in the many states that have modeled their procedural rules after the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, objections to personal jurisdiction are governed by Rule 12. The common law special appearance does not apply. But Rule 12 bears some resemblance to its common law ancestor. It still requires that the objection be asserted in the first response to the complaint, either a pre-answer motion or answer.

The major difference, however, is that a defendant who moves to dismiss in federal court under Rule 12 for lack of jurisdiction may, in the same motion, assert other pre-answer defenses. She could, for example, move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to join an indispensable party. If she raised those two objections in a jurisdiction that adheres to the older special appearance approach, she would be deemed to waive her objection to personal jurisdiction by also raising an issue that is presumably only relevant if the court has jurisdiction.

Five days later, before the court rules on his objections, he removes the action to federal court. After removal, he moves to dismiss, on the ground that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over him. Goloupolos argues that the defense has been waived.

For example, a lawyer might be asked to produce a statement she had taken from a witness to the events in suit, or an index she had made of a file containing large numbers of documents in a client\u2019s possession, or a memo to a partner stating which documents in the client\u2019s files were relevant to the opposing party\u2019s claim. Such documents, created in the course of representation and for the purpose of preparing the case, are clearly relevant to the issues in the case, under Rule 26(b)(1). Yet allowing discovery of these materials would severely impact lawyers\u2019 practices, since they could reveal counsel\u2019s case evaluation and trial strategy to the opposing party. In Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947), the Supreme Court held that such \u2018\u2018attorney work product\u2019\u2019 should be protected from disclosure, at least absent a showing of a particular need for the information and inability to obtain it through other means. The Court was concerned that discovery of trial preparation materials would interfere with lawyers\u2019 ability to develop their case strategy in private, and lead lawyers to build their cases by forcing disclosure of opposing counsel\u2019s efforts rather than undertaking their own. Thus, the Court created a limited objection to shield work product materials from discovery. This is an additional limit on access to materials, even if they satisfy the broad relevance standard in Rule 26(b)(1). In 1970, Rule 26(b)(3), entitled \u2018\u2018Trial Preparation: Materials\u2019\u2019 was added to the Federal Rules. That Rule partially codifies the protection Hickman provided to work product materials. Under Rule 26(b)(3), trial preparation materials are protected from discovery if three criteria are met. The materials must be \u2018\u2018documents or tangible things.\u2019\u2019 They must be \u2018\u2018prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial,\u2019\u2019 and they must be prepared \u2018\u2018by or for another party or its representative. . . .\u2019\u2019 If these criteria are met, the materials need not ordinarily be produced in discovery. So, the first issue to consider in analyzing a claim of work product protection is whether the materials are presumptively protected. That depends on the three criteria in Rule 26(b)(3)(A). Not all documents in the possession of a lawyer are trial preparation materials. Suppose, for example, that Jackson is defending the City police department on a charge of unlawful arrest, and the chief of police sends him a copy of the booking sheet concerning the arrest and the arresting officer\u2019s report about the incident that gave rise to the arrest. These are not trial preparation materials. They are \u2018\u2018documents or tangible things,\u2019\u2019 and they are prepared by or for another party (the police department) but they are not \u2018\u2018prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\u2019\u2019 They are simply the general business records of the police department, made as a matter of routine in every case, whether litigation may follow or not. Although they were sent to counsel in the course of defending the case, that is not enough to make them work product. If it were, all documents would be shielded from discovery simply because they were sent to counsel. If a document meets the criteria for work product under Rule 26(b) (3)(A), the presumptive protection for such materials may still be overcome in some circumstances. Under the rule, the court may order production of protected materials if the party seeking them shows that it has \u2018\u2018substantial need for the materials to prepare its case\u2019\u2019 and cannot obtain their substantial equivalent by other means. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3)(A)(ii). However, even if the requesting party cannot otherwise obtain the material, some items may not be discoverable under Rule 26(b)(3). Work product need not be produced, even if a substantial need is shown, if it would reveal \u2018\u2018the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party\u2019s attorney or other representative concerning the litigation.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(B). It may be helpful to think of Rule 26(b)(3) in terms of a decision tree: Step #1: Is the material a document or tangible thing? Was it prepared by or for another party? Was it prepared in anticipation of litigation? If the answer to these questions is \u2018\u2018yes,\u2019\u2019 the document enjoys presumptive protection under Rule 26(b)(3). Then go on to Step #2. Step #2: Does the requesting party have a substantial need for the material in preparing its case? Is it unable to obtain equivalent information by other means? If the answer to both questions is \u2018\u2018yes,\u2019\u2019 it will have to be produced despite presumptive work product protection. . . . unless . . .

For example, in Hickman, opposing counsel sought production of Fortenbaugh\u2019s recollections of his interviews with witnesses, as well as his notes of other interviews. Rule 26(b)(3) would not protect this information, since it is not a \u2018\u2018document or tangible thing.\u2019\u2019 It isn\u2019t clear why the rulemakers, in drafting Rule 26(b)(3), chose to address only work product objections to production of documents and tangible things. It might be argued that, since they chose to protect these from disclosure (unless the appropriate showing is made), by implication, other work product\u2014that is, intangible work product like Fortenbaugh\u2019s recollections of witness interviews\u2014are not protected. However, this has not been the reading of the courts. Most courts have held that intangible work product continues to enjoy protection under standards established in the Hickman case itself. Thus, they need not be produced absent some showing of extraordinary need. See, e.g., Sporck v. Peil, 759 F.2d 312 (3d Cir. 1985). And \u2018\u2018opinion work product\u2019\u2019\u2014the mental impressions of counsel\u2014is probably protected from disclosure in almost all cases. So, consider the following worthy Closer.  A good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties\u2019 relative access to relevant information, the parties\u2019 resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of \u2018\u2018any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.\u2019\u2019 In an effort to rein in discovery, the \u2018\u2018relevant to the claim or defense of any party\u2019\u2019 language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to \u2018\u2018the subject matter of the pending action,\u2019\u2019 but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called \u2018\u2018proportionality factors\u2019\u2019 in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the \u2018\u2018relevant to a claim or defense in the action\u2019\u2019 standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff\u2019s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants\u2019 arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is discoverable even though it isn\u2019t admissible as evidence at a trial. \u2018\u2018Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\u2019\u2019 For example, statements that are \u2018\u2018hearsay,\u2019\u2019 that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here\u2019s a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).  Because the standard for relevance in Rule 26(b)(1), as amended in 2000, is tied to the claims and defenses in the case, the parties\u2019 pleadings play an important role in determining the scope of discovery. By raising issues in the pleadings, the parties lay themselves open to discovery on issues which otherwise might remain free from inquiry. Prior to the amendment, the pleadings were less central to the scope of discovery, since any information relevant to \u2018\u2018the subject matter of the action,\u2019\u2019 rather than the \u2018\u2018claims or defenses\u2019\u2019 raised by the parties was subject to discovery. In the following question, consider whether the information sought is relevant to the claims and defenses of the parties.    \n\nQuestion:\n8. Exceeding the limits?

You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.  Frequently, a plaintiff sues two or more defendants on a tort claim for injuries arguably worth more than $75,000. Suppose, for example, that Epstein suffers nerve damage during surgery, and that the damages are $90,000. He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith\u2019s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe\u2019s fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe \u2018\u2018jointly and severally liable\u2019\u2019 for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence. But the amount requirement would be met in either type of jurisdiction. As long as either defendant might be held liable for the full $90,000, that amount is \u2018\u2018in controversy\u2019\u2019 between her and the plaintiff. Since either Smith or Doe might be found solely at fault, either might be held liable for the full $90,000. To illustrate: \n\nQuestion:\n10. Aggravation of damages.

Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This \u2018\u2018aggregation\u2019\u2019 problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot \u2018\u2018aggregate\u2019\u2019 claims against different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a \u2018\u2018common, undivided interest.\u2019\u2019 (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at Chapter 14, pp. 279-283. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.  Frequently, a plaintiff sues two or more defendants on a tort claim for injuries arguably worth more than $75,000. Suppose, for example, that Epstein suffers nerve damage during surgery, and that the damages are $90,000. He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith\u2019s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe\u2019s fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe \u2018\u2018jointly and severally liable\u2019\u2019 for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence. But the amount requirement would be met in either type of jurisdiction. As long as either defendant might be held liable for the full $90,000, that amount is \u2018\u2018in controversy\u2019\u2019 between her and the plaintiff. Since either Smith or Doe might be found solely at fault, either might be held liable for the full $90,000. To illustrate: \n\nQuestion:\n11. Stooges do the math.

When litigation eventuates, opposing lawyers generally want it all. In big cases, this can make discovery hugely expensive and especially contentious. The Federal Rules now contain several provisions to assist judges in handling the problems posed by electronic discovery: \u2022 Rules 33(d) and 34(a)(1)(A) expressly provide that \u2018\u2018electronically stored information\u2019\u2019 is subject to discovery. There has never been much doubt that such information is discoverable, but it\u2019s clear now that it is. \u2022 Rule 26(b)(2)(B) provides that parties need not provide electronic information that is \u2018\u2018not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost.\u2019\u2019 The burden falls on the party who objects on this basis to show that the information is not reasonably accessible. If the party carries that burden, the court may still order production, but only for good cause and under appropriate provisions (such as cost sharing). This emphasizes that the burden of producing information is an important factor in limiting discovery and calls on the judge to make careful judgments about whether and how much of this information must be produced. \u2022 Rule 37\u2014which addresses sanctions for inadequate participation in discovery\u2014expressly addresses failure to preserve electronically stored information relevant to anticipated or current litigation. Rule 37(e)(1) authorizes the court to impose orders\u2014 such as measures to retrieve the information, allowing evidence of the loss of the information, or barring evidence about a claim or defense to which the missing evidence is relevant. For intentional destruction of such evidence, Rule 37(e)(2) allows more drastic sanctions, up to and including a default judgment or dismissal of a violator\u2019s claim. \u2022 Rule 26(b)(5)(B) addresses another problem intensified by electronic discovery. Because parties often produce huge masses of material in electronic discovery exchanges, they will sometimes discover that, without meaning to, they have produced documents that were privileged or subject to work product protection. Rule 26(b)(5)(B) allows a party who has made such an \u2018\u2018inadvertent disclosure\u2019\u2019 to notify the receiving party of the mistake. If so notified, the receiving party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim [of privilege or work product protection]. The producing party must preserve the information until the claim is resolved. This provision attempts to freeze the status quo until the producing party\u2019s claim of privilege can be resolved. It does not provide that the information is still privileged despite its inadvertent production; rather, it bars any use of it until a court determines whether producing it in discovery has waived the right to keep it confidential. The question below probes the meaning of this quizzical provision.\n\nQuestion:\n8. Gimme, Gimme! Black Corporation sues White Corporation for patent infringement. The case involves very large numbers of files, some electronic, others in print, that contain technical data about the development of a complex turbine for generating energy from the tides. After Black produces its files in response to White\u2019s request for production, it discovers that it has mistakenly produced to White\u2019s lawyers a hard copy of a memo written by its chief engineer, Pasco. Pasco wrote the memo after the suit was filed, offering her assessment to Black\u2019s board of directors of the overlap between Black\u2019s turbine design and White\u2019s, to assist the board in deciding whether to litigate or settle the case. Shortly after producing it, Black\u2019s lawyers ask for it back, claiming that it is protected as work product and citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5)(B).

R. Civ. P. 50(b). Rule 50(b) provides that, if a motion for a judgment as a matter of law is denied, the motion may be renewed no later than twenty-eight days after entry of judgment. This establishes two prerequisites for the motion. First, it must be made within twenty-eight days after judgment is entered on the jury\u2019s verdict for the plaintiff. Second, the party moving for judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) before the case went to the jury. There is an important practical reason for the requirement that a party who seeks judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for a judgment before the case is submitted to the jury. A party seeking judgment as a matter of law before the case goes to the jury must state the grounds for her position that the plaintiff\u2019s case is too weak. In Question 1, for example, Vicaro would state as grounds for the motion the lack of evidence of the relevant standard of medical care, that his treatment fell below that standard of care, or that his treatment caused Powers\u2019s condition. Now (while it\u2019s unlikely with such a glaring omission), it may be that Powers has this evidence and simply neglected to introduce it. If that is true, Vicaro\u2019s motion acts as a wake-up call to Powers\u2019s lawyer. When the defendant points out the gap in her evidence, she will ask the judge to allow her to reopen her case to offer the omitted evidence. Since a trial is a quest for truth rather than a game of skill, the judge should allow her to do so, absent unfair surprise to Vicaro. So, by requiring the challenge to the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s case at a point where the omission can be remedied, Rule 50(b) facilitates the trial of the case on the merits. In the federal courts, there is a second reason for the prior-motion requirement in order to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Supreme Court held, in a dubious decision, that reconsidering the jury\u2019s verdict violates the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial, unless the judge reserved the right to do so on a motion made before the case went to the jury.

Pelham\u2019s second action\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nwill not be barred, because the state court will view his assault and battery claims as based on different primary rights from the claims asserted in his first action.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nNecessary-to-the-judgment hypos make natural closers, because they are so difficult for students to grasp. This requirement seems arbitrary and technical, even silly. But let\u2019s try to understand why courts have consistently included this mysterious limitation on collateral estoppel. Cambria v. Jeffrey, 307 Mass. 49 (1940), provides a classic example of the problem. In slightly simplified form, the facts were as follows: Cambria had an accident with Jeffrey and sued Jeffrey for negligence in causing his injuries. Jeffrey pleaded contributory negligence. At the time of this crusty case, contributory negligence of a plaintiff barred recovery entirely, even if the defendant was negligent too. The case was tried before a judge, not a jury. The judge found that Cambria was negligent, and that Jeffrey was negligent as well. Question: What judgment should the judge enter based on these factual findings? He should dismiss Cambria\u2019s suit. Under the contributory negligence doctrine, a plaintiff who was partially at fault in causing the accident could not recover. The plaintiff had to be blameless to recover, and Cambria was negligent, so he lost. But that wasn\u2019t the end of it. After the judge dismissed Cambria\u2019s suit, Jeffrey sued Cambria for his injuries. (At the time Massachusetts had no compulsory counterclaim rule, so Jeffrey had not waived his claim by failing to assert it in the first action.) Predictably, Cambria pleaded that Jeffrey was contributorily negligent, and asserted that Jeffrey was estopped from denying his negligence, since the judge in the first suit had found that he was. This isn\u2019t a bad argument; the parties litigated Jeffrey\u2019s negligence in Suit One, and the judge decided that he was negligent, so why should Jeffrey be allowed to litigate it again? Despite this logic, the court in Cambria v. Jeffrey held that Jeffrey could litigate it again, because the judge\u2019s finding in the first suit that Jeffrey was negligent was not \u2018\u2018necessary to the judgment.\u2019\u2019 Question: What finding was necessary to the judgment in Suit One? Why did Cambria lose? If you think about it, it\u2019s clear that Cambria did not lose because Jeffrey was negligent . . . that finding would tend to support liability! No, he lost because he (Cambria) was negligent. At the time, a contributorily negligent plaintiff could not win, whether the defendant was negligent or not. Thus, Cambria\u2019s negligence led to the judgment, but the finding that Jeffrey was negligent was irrelevant to the outcome in the first action. Because the judge in the first action never had to decide whether Jeffrey was negligent, that finding was a form of dicta. The finding didn\u2019t affect the outcome, so the judge may not have given it the same serious consideration he would have if it would affect the result. Thus, we can\u2019t have quite the level of confidence in this irrelevant conclusion that we have in a finding that leads to the judgment in the case. There\u2019s another problem with findings that don\u2019t lead to the judgment. They are, usually, unreviewable: Question: Put yourself in Jeffrey\u2019s shoes. The judge has found him negligent. He contemplates a suit against Cambria for his own injuries in the accident. What would he want to do if he feared that he would be estopped from relitigating his negligence in the second action? Naturally, if Jeffrey fears being stuck with the finding that he was negligent, he would want to appeal it and get it reversed, so it would not come back to haunt him in his later suit for his own injuries. Question: If Jeffrey appealed the judge\u2019s finding in the first action that he was negligent, what would the appellate court do? Very likely, the appellate court would say, \u2018\u2018What are you doing here, Jeffrey? You won below. Why should we review the finding that you were negligent? The issue is moot. Even if we agreed with you, it wouldn\u2019t change the outcome, so why should we waste our time reviewing an irrelevant conclusion?\u2019\u2019 And how could they meaningfully review it? If Jeffrey appealed, why would Cambria spend the money to oppose the appeal? He lost anyway, he isn\u2019t likely to litigate an appeal about Jeffrey\u2019s negligence out of pure curiosity. So, Jeffrey would probably not be able to obtain appellate review of the trial judge\u2019s finding that he was negligent. Since the finding did not affect the outcome, and can\u2019t be corrected on appeal, most courts would not give collateral estoppel effect to it. The trick, of course, is to distinguish such miscellaneous findings from those that do affect the outcome, that are \u2018\u2018necessary to the judgment.\u2019\u2019 Consider this case.\n\nQuestion:\n9. Triple play. Perez sues the City of Atlantis, alleging that the mayor violated his First Amendment rights by demoting him from his city job to a lower-paying one because he had supported Appolonia, the losing candidate for mayor in the 2018 election. The City raises three defenses. It denies that Perez was demoted, arguing that he was transferred to an equivalent position. Second, it claims that the mayor never believed that Perez supported Appolonia, so could not have discriminated against him on that basis. Last, it claims that Perez had waived any claim for demotion when he agreed to accept his new position. The case went to trial on all three issues. The jury rendered a general verdict, finding the City liable to Perez for violating his First Amendment rights. A year later, Perez is fired. He sues again, claiming that he was fired in violation of his First Amendment rights, because the mayor believed he had supported Appolonia in the 2018 election.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nPerez may not estop the City from relitigating whether the mayor believed that Perez had supported Appolonia. Since the City raised three defenses, we cannot tell which findings were necessary to the judgment in the first case.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nThe cases we\u2019ve analyzed so far have involved situations in which one of the parties to Suit One invokes collateral estoppel in a later action between the same parties.

This is a case of \u2018\u2018mutual collateral estoppel,\u2019\u2019 because Doe, the party invoking estoppel in the second action was a party to the first, litigated it against Smith in that action, and prevailed on the issue in Suit One. However, an issue previously litigated and decided may arise in later litigation involving a new party as well. Suppose, for example, that Forrestal Corporation sues Quantum Software for infringing its patent, and loses because the jury finds that the patent is invalid. Subsequently, Forrestal sues Apex Corporation for infringing on the patent. Apex would like to invoke collateral estoppel, arguing that Forrestal litigated and lost on the patent issue in Suit One and should not be able to relitigate the issue.

But it is useful to introduce the problem of cases that include some claims that satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction, but also others that do not. Very commonly, cases involve not one claim, but several\u2014perhaps two, or perhaps ten. Civil procedure has a nasty doctrine called res judicata, which provides that once you have sued a defendant for claims arising out of a set of events, you can\u2019t do it again. Consequently, lawyers know that whatever claims they have against a defendant arising from a particular dispute must be asserted when they bring suit the first time. Suppose, for example, that Greenstein, a New Yorker, sues Panil, another New Yorker, for infringing her patent, claiming that she had licensed Panil to use the patented device for limited purposes, but Panil had exceeded those limits. This claim arises under the federal patent statutes, so the federal court has arising-under jurisdiction to hear it. However, Greenstein might also allege a claim for breach of contract as well, based on the same acts by Panil. This is a state claim between two parties from the same state. It doesn\u2019t arise under federal law, and there\u2019s no diversity. If it were brought alone, the federal court would not have jurisdiction to hear it. But it wasn\u2019t brought alone; it was brought along with a proper federal claim and arises from the same events. It makes sense that it should be litigated along with the federal claim. But how can it be? Subject matter jurisdiction is fundamental, and what gives the federal court subject matter jurisdiction over Greenstein\u2019s contract claim? The Supreme Court has held that where the plaintiff asserts a claim that properly supports federal court jurisdiction, it is constitutionally permissible for the federal court to hear the entire dispute between the parties, including other claims that arise from the same \u2018\u2018nucleus of operative facts\u2019\u2019 but could not be brought in federal court alone. United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966). And Congress has conveyed such \u2018\u2018supplemental\u2019\u2019 jurisdiction to the federal district courts in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a), which authorizes the federal court, if it has jurisdiction over one claim, to hear other claims that are part of the same \u2018\u2018case or controversy.\u2019\u2019 Basically, a claim is part of the same case or controversy as the main claim (the one that gives the federal court jurisdiction) if it arises from the same set of underlying facts, the \u2018\u2018common nucleus of operative facts\u2019\u2019 test of Gibbs. So the bottom line is (a little oversimplified, but close enough until we get to Chapter 14) that a plaintiff who has asserted one substantial claim that properly invokes federal jurisdiction may have her entire dispute heard in federal court, including state law claims that couldn\u2019t otherwise be brought in federal court.

Isaacs also asserts a second claim in his complaint, alleging that firing him constituted a breach of his contract of employment. He asserts a third claim in the complaint, alleging that, a year before he was fired, United had misappropriated a design he created for a new grinding wheel.

Suppose that a defendant is sued in Arizona and believes that she is not subject to personal jurisdiction there. Naturally, she should object to personal jurisdiction. But suppose further that she isn\u2019t sure that her objection will carry the day; it\u2019s a close issue, as so many personal jurisdiction issues are under minimum contacts analysis. And suppose that her tactical judgment is that, if she must litigate in Arizona, she would rather litigate in federal court in Arizona. What should she do? One thing she could do is to move to dismiss in the Arizona state court. But that motion is not likely to be ruled on within thirty days, and if she\u2019s going to remove, she\u2019s got to do it within thirty days. So she could do one of two things: She could move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in the state court (assuming that the state rules allow her to do that) and then remove to federal court within the thirty-day period. Her motion would then be pending in federal court instead of state court, and the federal court would rule on it. Or she could remove the case before a response was due in state court, and then, after removal, raise her objection to personal jurisdiction by a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss or in her answer to the complaint in federal court. Either way, the point is that removal does not waive the defendant\u2019s right to object to personal jurisdiction. It simply changes the court in which the objection will be litigated. It is true that, after removal, the question will be whether the federal court has personal jurisdiction. But generally the scope of personal jurisdiction in the federal court will be the same as that of the state court, because the Federal Rules require the federal court in most cases to conform to state limits on personal jurisdiction.

Boyle answers the complaint in state court, raising her defenses on the merits and including an objection to personal jurisdiction. Three days later Boyle files a notice of removal in federal court. Five days after removing, Boyle renews her motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Boyle\u2019s motion is\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nnot waived by removal. The court should dismiss if there is no personal jurisdiction over Boyle in Oregon, even though the case was properly removed.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nThe removal statute provides that \u2018\u2018all defendants who have been properly joined and served as defendants must join in or consent to the removal.\u2019\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a71446(b)(2)(a).

In fact, it continues to give rise to a great deal of fact-specific litigation, applying Shoe\u2019s general principles to the myriad facts of human experience. But the real kicker for my students has been the stream-of-commerce problem addressed\u2014or obfuscated\u2014in Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102 (1987) and revisited by the Court in J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro, 131 S. Ct. 2780 (2011). This section probes the meaning of so-called stream-of-commerce jurisdiction. \u2018\u2018Stream of commerce\u2019\u2019 is a phrase that refers to the entry of a defendant\u2019s products into the forum state through commercial channels of distribution. For example, suppose that Snoflake Incorporated makes snowblowers in Nevada and sells them to a wholesaler in Oregon, which resells them to retail stores in ten states, including Wyoming. If Wakimoto buys a Snoflake snowblower at a hardware store in Wyoming and is injured using it in Wyoming, will a Wyoming court have personal jurisdiction over Snowflake for his claim? Snoflake did not sell the snowblower in Wyoming itself. It may or may not have known that the wholesaler would resell its product there. But it did sell its product into the stream of commerce with the hope that it would be sold widely, and with knowledge that, if it was defective, it could injure a user wherever it was bought and used. And, of course, it cheerfully accepted the profits derived, ultimately, from sales in Wyoming. The stream-of-commerce question is whether Snoflake\u2019s sale of the product to the wholesaler in Oregon, with the hope and expectation that it would be resold to consumers in other states, establishes a sufficient contact with the final purchaser\u2019s state to support personal jurisdiction where Wakimoto buys and uses it and is injured by it. This is an important question, to which the Supreme Court has given only an equivocal answer. In World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson, the Court appeared to suggest that selling into the stream of commerce in one state, which leads to resale to consumers in a different state, would support jurisdiction there if the consumer was injured where she bought it (not where she took it, as World-Wide holds). See World-Wide, 444 U.S. at 297 (jurisdiction appropriate where injury results from manufacturer or distributor\u2019s efforts to \u2018\u2018serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in other states\u2019\u2019). But the Court later divided on this issue in Asahi. In Asahi, the defendant made a component that was incorporated into a final product in another country and resold into California. The question was whether the component maker had sufficient contacts with California to support jurisdiction, when a consumer bought the product there and was injured by it there. Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion suggested that a defendant that merely sold its product to another company, without controlling where that other company would redistribute it as part of its final product, was not subject to jurisdiction where the finished product was ultimately sold. Jurisdiction, Justice O\u2019Connor suggested, is based on purposeful availment, and the mere sale of a part\u2014or 100,000 parts\u2014from Japan to Taiwan did not establish minimum contacts with California. Instead, she would require that a defendant like Asahi actually establish direct contacts in the consumer\u2019s state to subject it to suit there for injuries caused by its products sold in the state. She would find such \u2018\u2018purposeful availment\u2019\u2019 if the defendant establishes sales agents in the state, advertises there, has dealership networks there, or makes other deliberate efforts, itself, to market its goods in the state of ultimate sale to the consumer. Justice Brennan\u2019s concurring opinion in Asahi, however, appeared to accept the principle that sales of large quantities of the defendant\u2019s product in an American state, even indirectly through the stream of commerce, would support jurisdiction in that state, if the plaintiff suffered injury there from the product. Justice Stevens, while finding it unnecessary to reach the minimum contacts question, also appeared inclined to find jurisdiction based on indirect sales in a state, depending on the nature and quantity of those sales. However, while the Justices could not agree on what constitutes \u2018\u2018purposeful availment\u2019\u2019 in a stream- of-commerce case, eight did agree that, even if minimum contacts existed, it would be unreasonable on the facts of the case for the California court to exercise jurisdiction over Asahi, since the dispute remaining after the plaintiff settled was a claim for indemnification between two Asian corporations. We Civil Procedure wonks waited long and anxiously\u2014for twenty- four years\u2014for the Court to clarify this vexing problem. Finally the Court took certiorari in J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873 (2011), and we looked forward to further wisdom on stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Alas, fooled again. The case involved a machine made in England, imported to a distributor in Ohio, and resold into New Jersey. Nicastro was injured there using the machine and brought suit against the English manufacturer in New Jersey. It argued, predictably, that it was not subject to personal jurisdiction for this claim in New Jersey, since it had done nothing in New Jersey at all; it had just made machines in England and sold them to a distributor in Ohio. In Nicastro the Court again split badly on the reach of stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Justice Kennedy\u2019s plurality opinion, joined by three other justices, concluded that J. McIntyre had not \u2018\u2018engaged in conduct purposely directed to New Jersey\u2019\u2019 (564 U.S. at 886) and therefore could not be sued in New Jersey for Nicastro\u2019s claim. Two justices filed a concurring opinion saying, essentially, \u2018\u2018no jurisdiction on these facts but we might rule differently if there were a regular course of sales into New Jersey, or deliberate efforts to cultivate the New Jersey market.\u2019\u2019 And three dissenters argued, vociferously, that J. McIntyre had sought to cultivate the United States market, had succeeded in doing so, and ought to defend the product in a state where it was resold to the ultimate user and caused injury. So, neither Asahi nor McIntyre provides clear guidance on the stream-of-commerce problem. There will be a lot of unclear cases, and expensive litigation of the jurisdiction issue in such cases will continue. Perhaps this is inevitable; perhaps the Justices have not given us a clear answer because there never can be one for a problem with so many possible variations. But the following questions may help you to at least define the parameters of the problem.\n\nQuestion:\n9. Between two extremes. Atlanta Precision Drill Corporation makes drill presses in Georgia.

Neff to Shaffer v. Heitner, attachment jurisdiction was widely invoked to support jurisdiction over unrelated claims. It was routinely used, for example, to attach intangible assets, such as bank deposits. This expanded the doctrine beyond its traditional roots, which involved physical control of physical assets. It is harder to think of a bank account, which is a contractual right to repayment of the deposited amount, as physically \u2018\u2018present\u2019\u2019 in a particular place. Harris v. Balk, 198 U.S. 215 (1905), was an extreme example of the use of attachment jurisdiction to seize an intangible asset. In Harris, Epstein, a Maryland citizen with a claim against Balk, learned that Harris, who owed money to Balk, was coming to Maryland. Epstein sued Balk in Maryland, and obtained a writ of attachment for the seizure of Harris\u2019s debt to Balk. He then served the writ on Harris while he was in Maryland. The Supreme Court concluded that Harris\u2019s debt to Balk traveled with him, so that it could be \u2018\u2018seized\u2019\u2019 in Maryland while Harris was there, and disposed of by order of the Maryland court. This was an exercise of attachment, or quasi in rem type II jurisdiction, because Harris\u2019s debt to Balk was completely unrelated to Epstein\u2019s claim against Balk. It simply provided an unrelated asset that could be seized by the court and used to satisfy Epstein\u2019s claim. Shaffer involved a similarly extreme exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction. Heitner sued officers and directors of Greyhound Company in Delaware, asserting a claim arising out of alleged mismanagement of the company\u2019s business in Oregon. Many of the defendants had not acted in Delaware, and had no other connection to Delaware that would support personal jurisdiction over them there. But many of them owned Greyhound stock. And Delaware had a statute that declared all shares of stock in Delaware corporations to be present in Delaware. Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8, \u00a7169 (1975). So, Heitner sought\u2014and was granted\u2014a court order seizing (\u2018\u2018sequestering\u2019\u2019) the Greyhound stock owned by the defendants. Here, as in Harris v. Balk, Heitner did not claim any preexisting ownership interest in the stock itself. Rather, he sought to adjudicate an unrelated claim that arose in Oregon based on the court\u2019s seizure of these intangible assets. Like the plaintiff\u2019s ploy in Harris, this was an exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction\u2014very type II. In Shaffer, the Court held that the artificial distinction between exercising jurisdiction over the defendant and exercising jurisdiction over his property in quasi in rem type II cases \u2018\u2018supports an ancient form without substantial modern justification.\u2019\u2019 433 U.S. at 212.

But federal courts exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants too. Thus, it\u2019s important to understand the limits on their power to force defendants to defend in a particular district as well. The constitutional limits on a state court\u2019s power to exercise jurisdiction are rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which provides, \u2018\u2018nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law\u2019\u2019 (emphasis supplied). The Fourteenth Amendment applies to the states; it does not apply to the federal government. The Fifth Amendment contains a similar due process clause that does apply to the federal government and its courts. However, it has been interpreted somewhat differently from the Fourteenth. Generally, the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause has been held to allow a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant if she has an appropriate relation to the United States as a whole, not to a particular state. See, e.g., Busch v. Buchman, Buchman & O\u2019Brien Law Firm, 11 F.3d 1255, 1258 (5th Cir. 1994); see generally Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a71068.1. Thus, a defendant with a contact anywhere in the country can probably be required to defend an action arising from that contact in any federal court (just as a defendant with appropriate contacts anywhere in California is subject to jurisdiction in a California court in any part of the state, under the Fourteenth Amendment). Under this analysis, if McGee bought insurance in North Carolina, he could sue the insurer on the policy in a Utah federal court, and it would be constitutional under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause for the Utah federal court to entertain the case, since it arises out of contacts in the United States.7 Even if contacts anywhere in the country will support \u2018\u2018nationwide jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 over a defendant, federal courts seldom exercise such broad jurisdiction. In the federal courts, as in the state courts, jurisdiction must not only be within constitutional limits, but must also be authorized by statute, or, in this case, by court rule.8 In most cases, the reach of personal jurisdiction in the federal courts is governed by Fed. R. Civ.

A federal court sitting in Texas could exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant if the courts of Texas could, and so on. Clearly, this rule restricts federal jurisdiction in many cases in which the Fifth Amendment would allow much wider jurisdiction. The rule has the great virtue, however, of making the reach of personal jurisdiction the same (in most cases) in the federal and state courts sitting in the same state. This neutralizes personal jurisdiction as a forum shopping factor: Under Rule 4(k)(1)(A), the plaintiff won\u2019t be able to obtain jurisdiction over a defendant in federal court unless she could in the local state courts. There are some situations in which federal courts do exercise broader jurisdiction than the state courts. Congress may authorize nationwide jurisdiction in particular types of cases. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. \u00a71361 (authorizing nationwide service of process in interpleader cases). But such statutes are the exception.

Well, it may happen for a number of reasons. First, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer may not have done her homework, so she doesn\u2019t realize that a particular claim is legally insufficient. In other cases (unfortunately), lawyers may include legally dubious claims for tactical reasons, even if they doubt that they will ultimately support recovery.

Here\u2019s a question that illustrates the trial judge\u2019s dilemma.\n\nQuestion:\n2. Authority on point. Angeles sues Centerville Hospital, a hospital in the state of Euphoria, for medical malpractice by Dr. Kildare, who operated on her at Centerville. Angeles alleges that Dr. Kildare negligently performed the operation, and that Centerville is liable for Kildare\u2019s negligence, even if Kildare was an independent contractor rather than an employee of Centerville. Her theory is that, to the patient, the surgeon appears to be an employee of the hospital, even though surgeons are often actually independent contractors who merely contract for use of hospital facilities. Euphoria courts have never decided whether a hospital is liable for acts of surgeons who use its facilities, under this \u2018\u2018apparent authority\u2019\u2019 theory. Courts in a few other states have accepted the argument, however. In her complaint, Angeles alleges that she reasonably believed that Dr. Kildare was an employee of Centerville. She further alleges that Centerville is liable for Kildare\u2019s negligence, based on this \u2018\u2018apparent authority\u2019\u2019 theory.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe court should dismiss the complaint if it concludes that Euphoria does not recognize the \u2018\u2018apparent authority\u2019\u2019 theory, even though Angeles has pleaded that she reasonably believed that Dr. Kildare was an employee of the hospital.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo B is the best answer. If the trial court concludes that Euphoria law doesn\u2019t impose liability on a hospital for the acts of an independent contractor/ surgeon (even if the patient thought she worked for the hospital), the trial court will dismiss the claim for \u2018\u2018failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u2019\u2019 In so doing, the trial court is \u2018\u2018making\u2019\u2019 Euphoria law. If Angeles thinks the trial judge is wrong in rejecting her claim, she can appeal the dismissal, and get a decision from an appellate court on the apparent authority theory.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nState law is not static. It may change while a federal diversity case is being litigated, before it is litigated, after it is litigated, or while it is on appeal. If it changes during the litigation, should the federal court conform to the state law as it existed when the case arose, when it was filed, when it was tried, or as of some other point in the litigation? Here\u2019s a question that illustrates the problem. The basic premises of Erie should help you to choose the best answer.\n\nQuestion:\n7. Comedy of errors. Laurel and Hardy are injured when they are traveling in Fields\u2019s car in the State of Emporia and Fields collides with Gleason. Laurel and Hardy bring a diversity action against Fields and Gleason in federal court. Under Emporia case law, it is unclear whether, if Gleason and Fields were both negligent, they would be liable for their percentages of fault (several liability) or each liable for the plaintiff\u2019s full damages (joint and several liability). The federal district judge, making her best guess at the law of Emporia on the liability of joint tortfeasors, concludes that the Emporia Supreme Court would apply joint and several liability. Consequently, after the jury finds both Fields and Gleason negligent, she holds each defendant liable for Laurel and Hardy\u2019s full damages, rather than for reduced damages based on each defendant\u2019s percentage of negligence. Fields appeals her ruling to the federal Court of Appeals. Gleason does not appeal. While Fields\u2019s appeal is pending, the Emporia Supreme Court holds, in an unrelated case, that several liability is the proper rule in joint tortfeasor cases. Fields\u2019s federal appeal is heard after the Emporia Supreme Court\u2019s decision comes down. Fields argues that the Court of Appeals should apply several liability to his case, even though the trial judge had applied joint and several liability. Gleason, the other defendant, moves for relief from the judgment against him in the federal district court, on the ground that the judgment was based on a mistake concerning the applicable law. The federal Court of Appeals will\n\nAnswer Candidate:\naffirm the decision in Fields\u2019s case, if the trial court\u2019s reading of Emporia law was a reasonable reading of Emporia law at the time of trial. It will deny Gleason\u2019s motion for relief from judgment.\n\nAnalysis:\nIn this example the federal judge did her best to ascertain the content of Emporia law. However, her prediction of Emporia law on joint and several liability turned out to be wrong. The Emporia Supreme Court has now made it clear that several liability is the law of Emporia. What should the federal diversity court now do about Laurel and Hardy\u2019s cases? There\u2019s an argument for A. The federal trial judge conscientiously performed her role under Erie: She made her best guess at the content of Emporia law, based on the precedents at the time, and applied it to the case. If Fields\u2019s appeal is decided under a \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 liability rule, it might have to be remanded for retrial, even though it was fairly tried under the law as the judge understood it at the time. This seems wasteful. On the other hand, by taking his appeal, Fields has challenged the trial judge\u2019s ruling that joint and several liability applies in Emporia. When the Court of Appeals reviews that ruling, shouldn\u2019t it consider all the data concerning the content of Emporia law? And what better data could there be on the point than this new decision from the Emporia Supreme Court? It seems artificial to uphold the trial judge\u2019s conclusion about Emporia law on the ground that it was reasonable at the time, when we now know that it was wrong. On this reasoning, the Court of Appeals will reverse the judgment against Fields and remand the case for entry of a new judgment based on several liability. The Court of Appeals, like the federal district court, must make its best guess at the content of Emporia law at the time it reviews the case, and it is now clear that several liability is the law of Emporia. Thus A is wrong. But what will the federal trial court do about Gleason\u2019s motion for relief from judgment? Now that it is clear that Gleason\u2019s liability should be \u2018\u2018several\u2019\u2019 under Emporia law, shouldn\u2019t he get relief from the judgment, which was entered based on joint and several liability? There\u2019s an argument for Gleason\u2019s position, but it will very likely be rejected. Gleason\u2019s case is over. If he were allowed to challenge that judgment based on a later change\u2014or clarification\u2014of the law, judgments could be reopened whenever the law changed. This would place a large burden on the system, and undermine the finality of judgments. \u2018\u2018There is nothing in Erie that suggests that consistency must be achieved at the expense of finality, or that federal cases finally disposed of must be revisited any time an unrelated state case clarifies the applicable rules of law.\u2019\u2019 DeWeerth v. Baldinger, 38 F.3d 1266 (2d Cir. 1994). Fields\u2019s case is distinguishable, since he took an appeal, which was still pending at the time the state law changed. He had persisted in claiming that several liability applies and was still litigating the question in the original case when the Emporia court clarified its position. So, B is wrong. C is the best answer.\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nWhy would a plaintiff assert a claim in her complaint that fails to state a compensable claim under applicable law?

Thus A is wrong. But what will the federal trial court do about Gleason\u2019s motion for relief from judgment? Now that it is clear that Gleason\u2019s liability should be \u2018\u2018several\u2019\u2019 under Emporia law, shouldn\u2019t he get relief from the judgment, which was entered based on joint and several liability? There\u2019s an argument for Gleason\u2019s position, but it will very likely be rejected. Gleason\u2019s case is over. If he were allowed to challenge that judgment based on a later change\u2014or clarification\u2014of the law, judgments could be reopened whenever the law changed. This would place a large burden on the system, and undermine the finality of judgments. \u2018\u2018There is nothing in Erie that suggests that consistency must be achieved at the expense of finality, or that federal cases finally disposed of must be revisited any time an unrelated state case clarifies the applicable rules of law.\u2019\u2019 DeWeerth v. Baldinger, 38 F.3d 1266 (2d Cir. 1994). Fields\u2019s case is distinguishable, since he took an appeal, which was still pending at the time the state law changed. He had persisted in claiming that several liability applies and was still litigating the question in the original case when the Emporia court clarified its position. So, B is wrong. C is the best answer.\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nGuaranty Trust Co. v.

Under Minnesota\u2019s approach, the claim would be barred, since Noriega was not served in hand within the limitations period.

That case, and the other early post-Erie cases, did not clearly distinguish conflicts between state law and a Federal Rule from conflicts between state law and federal judicial practices unguided by the Rules. Under York\u2019s approach, the cases asked whether ignoring the state rule was likely to make the case come out differently in federal court than it would in state court. If it would, the state rule would be followed. So, C is wrong. It appeared, after York, that the federal courts would not analyze a conflict involving a Federal Rule any differently than other conflicts. The issue was whether using the state rule could lead to a different outcome than using the federal approach. Under York\u2019s outcome determinative test, it appeared that the federal courts would defer to state law, even if the issue were arguably controlled by a Federal Rule in federal court. Indeed, the Court applied state law in several cases after York that arguably were controlled by a Federal Rule. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe basic standard for removal jurisdiction is simple and sensible: a defendant sued in state court may remove a case to federal court if it could have been filed originally in federal court.

Plumer. But Hanna changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In Hanna, Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule. York and Byrd both involved such conflicts. York involved a conflict between a state statute and the judicial practice of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And Byrd involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal judicial practice of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these \u2018\u2018relatively unguided\u2019\u2019 Erie conflicts, Hanna reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in Byrd\u2019s language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because \u2018\u2018there can be no other law.\u2019\u2019 Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury\u2019s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy Erie sought to further\u2014uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts\u2014but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the Hanna opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of York\u2019s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are not prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and \u2018\u2018inequitable administration of the laws,\u2019\u2019 that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York line of cases would not require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following Question 1.) That\u2019s Hanna Part I. It\u2019s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in Hanna, unlike in York or in Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna construed Congress\u2019s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is \u2018\u2018rationally capable of classification\u2019\u2019 as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the \u2018\u2018outcome-determinative\u2019\u2019 test of York, or the more refined outcome-determinative test of Hanna Part I. But the rule involved in Hanna wasn\u2019t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to \u2018\u2018prescribe general rules of practice and procedure\u2019\u2019 for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a). In Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress\u2019s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted \u00a72072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that \u2018\u2018really regulates procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\u2019\u2019 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress\u2019s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress\u2019s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court\u2019s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b) provides that the Rules \u2018\u2018shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u2019\u2019 Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, \u00a72072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \u00a72072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and\u2014even if it is\u2014it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the \u2018\u2018modified outcome-determinative test\u2019\u2019 of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the \u2018\u2018Supreme Law of the Land.\u2019\u2019 United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under Hanna Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under Hanna Part II?\n\nQuestion:\n3. Branches of the decision tree. The State of Emporia has a statute that bars introduction of evidence that a party in a motor vehicle case was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of an accident. This statute prevents use of such evidence to show that the plaintiff was negligent, which, under Emporia negligence law, would reduce her recovery by whatever percentage of negligence the jury ascribes to her. In federal court, assume that no Federal Rule applies, but that judges generally hold that evidence is admitted if it is relevant to an issue in the case. The no-seatbelt evidence would be relevant to the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence. Tancredi sues Maguire for injuries in an accident. At trial, Maguire offers evidence that Tancredi was not wearing his seatbelt. The federal judge should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nexclude the evidence, because admitting it when the state court would not would lead to forum shopping and inequitable administration of the laws.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo the winner must be D or E. It should be D. The seat-belt evidence could make a big difference to Tancredi\u2019s case, since a jury might ascribe a large percentage of negligence to her for failing to wear a seatbelt. Thus, this difference between federal and state practice would significantly affect the choice between the two systems\u2014plaintiffs would choose state court, but defendants would very likely remove to get this evidence in front of the jury\u2014and the litigation opportunities in each. Consequently, under Hanna Part I, the federal court should follow the state practice. Here\u2019s another question to probe the relationship of the two Hanna tests.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThat is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer.

And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York line of cases would not require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following Question 1.) That\u2019s Hanna Part I. It\u2019s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in Hanna, unlike in York or in Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna construed Congress\u2019s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is \u2018\u2018rationally capable of classification\u2019\u2019 as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the \u2018\u2018outcome-determinative\u2019\u2019 test of York, or the more refined outcome-determinative test of Hanna Part I. But the rule involved in Hanna wasn\u2019t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to \u2018\u2018prescribe general rules of practice and procedure\u2019\u2019 for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a). In Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress\u2019s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted \u00a72072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that \u2018\u2018really regulates procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\u2019\u2019 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress\u2019s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress\u2019s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court\u2019s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b) provides that the Rules \u2018\u2018shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u2019\u2019 Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, \u00a72072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \u00a72072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and\u2014even if it is\u2014it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the \u2018\u2018modified outcome-determinative test\u2019\u2019 of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the \u2018\u2018Supreme Law of the Land.\u2019\u2019 United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under Hanna Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under Hanna Part II?\n\nQuestion:\n3. Branches of the decision tree. The State of Emporia has a statute that bars introduction of evidence that a party in a motor vehicle case was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of an accident. This statute prevents use of such evidence to show that the plaintiff was negligent, which, under Emporia negligence law, would reduce her recovery by whatever percentage of negligence the jury ascribes to her. In federal court, assume that no Federal Rule applies, but that judges generally hold that evidence is admitted if it is relevant to an issue in the case. The no-seatbelt evidence would be relevant to the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence. Tancredi sues Maguire for injuries in an accident. At trial, Maguire offers evidence that Tancredi was not wearing his seatbelt.

It is not the test for choosing between a federal judicial practice, like the federal practice here, and state law. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nLet\u2019s consider the joinder question from the point of view of the third- party defendant.

Clear Code in turn asserted a claim against Jasper, claiming that (while it was liable for Jasper\u2019s work) the problem resulted from his faulty programming, so that he should end up absorbing the loss.

Her theory is that, to the patient, the surgeon appears to be an employee of the hospital, even though surgeons are often actually independent contractors who merely contract for use of hospital facilities.

However, after granting supplemental jurisdiction very broadly in \u00a71367(a), Congress pulled back a bit in \u00a71367(b), which bars jurisdiction\u2014even if the test in \u00a71367(a) is satisfied\u2014over certain claims in diversity cases. Thus, the best way to analyze a \u00a71367 problem is to ask first, whether the added claim comes within the broad grant in \u00a71367(a). If it does, then ask whether it is one of the narrow set of claims that \u00a71367(b) excepts from supplemental jurisdiction. Section 1367(b) was drafted with Kroger in mind. Kroger had suggested that the federal courts shouldn\u2019t always exercise jurisdiction over related claims to the full extent of the power delineated in Gibbs. Kroger held that the federal courts should not hear claims by plaintiffs against third-party defendants in diversity cases, even if they arose out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the main claim, if doing so would be inconsistent with the long-standing complete diversity rule of Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. 267 (1806). In 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(b), Congress sought to preserve the Kroger limit on supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases. Section 1367(b). In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332. This provision is the source of most student confusion concerning supplemental jurisdiction. Basically, it provides that in diversity cases only, the federal court will not have supplemental jurisdiction over certain claims by plaintiffs or persons sought to be joined as plaintiffs. Not all claims, just some claims, defined in \u00a71367(b) by reference to the rules used to join them. The purpose for this exception to the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \u00a71367(a) is to prevent parties from evading the Strawbridge complete diversity rule. Under that rule, a plaintiff in a diversity case can\u2019t sue defendants from her own state. If she could achieve the same result by suing a diverse defendant and then using supplemental jurisdiction to add a claim against one who is not diverse, Strawbridge would be a dead letter. Some think it should be a dead letter, but Congress evidently doesn\u2019t. So \u00a71367(b) enumerates certain situations in which a plaintiff in a diversity case cannot rely on supplemental jurisdiction to assert additional claims, even if they arise out of the same case or controversy under \u00a71367(a). Section 1367(b) isn\u2019t too bad if you approach it in steps. \u2022 First, ask if jurisdiction over the main claim is based solely on diversity. If it isn\u2019t, stop! Section 1367(b) does not apply, because the first phrase in the subsection says \u2018\u2018in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332. . . .\u2019\u2019 \u2022 Next, if jurisdiction over the original case is based solely on diversity, ask if the claim you are analyzing was asserted by a plaintiff. If it isn\u2019t, stop! Section 1367(b) does not apply, because it only excepts certain \u2018\u2018claims by plaintiffs\u2019\u2019 (or persons being joined as plaintiffs under Rules 19 or 24). And the word \u2018\u2018plaintiff\u2019\u2019 means the original plaintiff, not a third-party plaintiff or a \u2018\u2018plaintiff\u2019\u2019 on a counterclaim. \u2022 Then, if the case is based on diversity, and the added claim is asserted by a plaintiff, you have to ask if it is a claim \u2018\u2018against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24\u2019\u2019 of the Federal Rules. If so, supplemental jurisdiction is barred. \u2022 Or, if the case involves Rule 19 or Rule 24, consider whether the person would be joined as a plaintiff under Rule 19 or intervene as a plaintiff under Rule 24. If so, \u00a71367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. \u2022 Last, just to be thorough, ask whether there is a basis for original jurisdiction over the added claim. If there is, the claim should be fine even though it is one of the claims described in \u00a71367(b). If the claim could have been asserted in federal court on its own, there is no need for supplemental jurisdiction. For example, if Luis, a plaintiff from Maine, asserts a claim against DeVoto (a third-party defendant in the case who is also from Maine) under a federal statute, who cares that there\u2019s no diversity, and who cares that \u00a71367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. This is a case that Luis could have asserted in federal court in a stand-alone suit, so the court has jurisdiction over it without regard to supplemental jurisdiction. An example should help. In analyzing it, ask first whether the federal court has original jurisdiction based on a proper federal court claim, then whether the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \u00a71367(a) applies, and then whether \u00a71367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction over it.\n\nQuestion:\n5. The exception that proves the rule. Cavers, from Wisconsin, sues Pariah Corporation, an Iowa corporation with its principal place of business in Iowa, for damages for defamation. He sues in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. He claims $50,000 in compensatory damages and $50,000 in punitive damages. Pariah impleads Pelosi, a former supervisor who allegedly gave it inaccurate information that led to publication of the defamatory statements. It seeks contribution, a state tort theory, from Pelosi, a Wisconsin citizen. After Pariah impleads Pelosi, Cavers asserts a claim directly against her, seeking $50,000 in compensatory damages for the defamation. (Assume that only the publisher may be liable for punitive damages.) Pelosi moves to dismiss Cavers\u2019s claim against her for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe court has supplemental jurisdiction over Cavers\u2019s claim against Pelosi under \u00a71367(a), but jurisdiction over it is barred by \u00a71367(b). Congress could have granted jurisdiction over this claim but didn\u2019t in the supplemental jurisdiction statute.\n\nAnalysis:\nBoth acknowledge that \u00a71367(b) bars the court from hearing Cavers\u2019s claim. A says that Congress could constitutionally authorize jurisdiction over it; B says that it couldn\u2019t. So you need to ask, \u2018\u2018What is the constitutional standard for jurisdiction over supplemental claims?\u2019\u2019 The answer is, the Gibbs common-nucleus-of-operative-fact test, which is essentially the same as the same-case-or-controversy test of \u00a71367(a). Since Cavers\u2019s claim against Pelosi does arise out of the same underlying facts, it is part of the same \u2018\u2018constitutional case\u2019\u2019 under Gibbs. Congress could have authorized jurisdiction over it, but chose instead to limit supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases more narrowly, just as the Court did in Kroger. So A takes the cake. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \u00a71367(a) is broad; indeed, it probably reaches to the outer limit of constitutional power to hear added claims, as defined in Gibbs. However, after granting supplemental jurisdiction very broadly in \u00a71367(a), Congress pulled back a bit in \u00a71367(b), which bars jurisdiction\u2014even if the test in \u00a71367(a) is satisfied\u2014over certain claims in diversity cases. Thus, the best way to analyze a \u00a71367 problem is to ask first, whether the added claim comes within the broad grant in \u00a71367(a). If it does, then ask whether it is one of the narrow set of claims that \u00a71367(b) excepts from supplemental jurisdiction. Section 1367(b) was drafted with Kroger in mind. Kroger had suggested that the federal courts shouldn\u2019t always exercise jurisdiction over related claims to the full extent of the power delineated in Gibbs. Kroger held that the federal courts should not hear claims by plaintiffs against third-party defendants in diversity cases, even if they arose out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the main claim, if doing so would be inconsistent with the long-standing complete diversity rule of Strawbridge v. Curtiss, 7 U.S. 267 (1806). In 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(b), Congress sought to preserve the Kroger limit on supplemental jurisdiction in diversity cases. Section 1367(b). In any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332 of this title, the district courts shall not have supplemental jurisdiction under subsection (a) over claims by plaintiffs against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or over claims by persons proposed to be joined as plaintiffs under Rule 19 of such rules, or seeking to intervene as plaintiffs under Rule 24 of such rules, when exercising supplemental jurisdiction over such claims would be inconsistent with the jurisdictional requirements of section 1332. This provision is the source of most student confusion concerning supplemental jurisdiction. Basically, it provides that in diversity cases only, the federal court will not have supplemental jurisdiction over certain claims by plaintiffs or persons sought to be joined as plaintiffs. Not all claims, just some claims, defined in \u00a71367(b) by reference to the rules used to join them. The purpose for this exception to the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \u00a71367(a) is to prevent parties from evading the Strawbridge complete diversity rule. Under that rule, a plaintiff in a diversity case can\u2019t sue defendants from her own state. If she could achieve the same result by suing a diverse defendant and then using supplemental jurisdiction to add a claim against one who is not diverse, Strawbridge would be a dead letter. Some think it should be a dead letter, but Congress evidently doesn\u2019t. So \u00a71367(b) enumerates certain situations in which a plaintiff in a diversity case cannot rely on supplemental jurisdiction to assert additional claims, even if they arise out of the same case or controversy under \u00a71367(a). Section 1367(b) isn\u2019t too bad if you approach it in steps. \u2022 First, ask if jurisdiction over the main claim is based solely on diversity. If it isn\u2019t, stop! Section 1367(b) does not apply, because the first phrase in the subsection says \u2018\u2018in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded solely on section 1332. . . .\u2019\u2019 \u2022 Next, if jurisdiction over the original case is based solely on diversity, ask if the claim you are analyzing was asserted by a plaintiff. If it isn\u2019t, stop! Section 1367(b) does not apply, because it only excepts certain \u2018\u2018claims by plaintiffs\u2019\u2019 (or persons being joined as plaintiffs under Rules 19 or 24). And the word \u2018\u2018plaintiff\u2019\u2019 means the original plaintiff, not a third-party plaintiff or a \u2018\u2018plaintiff\u2019\u2019 on a counterclaim. \u2022 Then, if the case is based on diversity, and the added claim is asserted by a plaintiff, you have to ask if it is a claim \u2018\u2018against persons made parties under Rule 14, 19, 20, or 24\u2019\u2019 of the Federal Rules. If so, supplemental jurisdiction is barred. \u2022 Or, if the case involves Rule 19 or Rule 24, consider whether the person would be joined as a plaintiff under Rule 19 or intervene as a plaintiff under Rule 24. If so, \u00a71367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. \u2022 Last, just to be thorough, ask whether there is a basis for original jurisdiction over the added claim. If there is, the claim should be fine even though it is one of the claims described in \u00a71367(b). If the claim could have been asserted in federal court on its own, there is no need for supplemental jurisdiction. For example, if Luis, a plaintiff from Maine, asserts a claim against DeVoto (a third-party defendant in the case who is also from Maine) under a federal statute, who cares that there\u2019s no diversity, and who cares that \u00a71367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction. This is a case that Luis could have asserted in federal court in a stand-alone suit, so the court has jurisdiction over it without regard to supplemental jurisdiction. An example should help. In analyzing it, ask first whether the federal court has original jurisdiction based on a proper federal court claim, then whether the broad grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \u00a71367(a) applies, and then whether \u00a71367(b) bars supplemental jurisdiction over it.\n\nQuestion:\n4. Exceptions, exceptions. Cavers, from Wisconsin, sues Pariah Corporation, an Iowa corporation with its principal place of business in Iowa, for damages for defamation. He sues in federal court, for $100,000, based on diversity jurisdiction. Pariah impleads Donnelly, a former supervisor for the company who allegedly made the actual statements on which Cavers\u2019s claim is based. It seeks indemnification (a state law theory of recovery) from Donnelly, an Iowa citizen, for any damages it is ordered to pay to Cavers. Donnelly moves to dismiss the claim against him for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe court does not have supplemental jurisdiction, because Donnelly and Pariah are both from Iowa.\n\nAnalysis:\nThis question is pretty easy if you understand the statute. D is clearly wrong. The fact that both of the parties to the impleader claim are from the same state means that there is no independent basis for subject matter jurisdiction over this state law claim. But that does not mean that there can\u2019t be a basis for supplemental jurisdiction. The whole point of supplemental jurisdiction is to authorize a federal court to hear claims that it cannot hear under original jurisdiction. So don\u2019t confuse standards for original jurisdiction, based on diversity or a claim arising under federal law, with standards for supplemental jurisdiction. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe grant of supplemental jurisdiction in \u00a71367(a) is broad; indeed, it probably reaches to the outer limit of constitutional power to hear added claims, as defined in Gibbs.

Patterson alleges in Paragraph 4 of his complaint that Adair was an employee of AE at the time of the accident, that Adair was acting in the scope of employment at the time of the accident (which Patterson must prove in order to recover from the employer), that Adair was talking on his cell phone at the time of the accident, and that Adair\u2019s negligent driving caused the accident. AE answers Paragraph 4 as follows: \u2018\u2018The defendant admits that Adair was its employee at the time of the accident, denies that Adair was negligent, but is without sufficient information to form a belief as to the truth of the allegation that Adair was talking on his cell phone at the time of the accident.\u2019\u2019 Under Federal Rule 8,\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nthe allegation that Adair is AE\u2019s employee is admitted. The allegation that he acted in the scope of employment is admitted. The allegation that Adair was talking on his cell phone is treated as denied.\n\nAnalysis:\nThis question simply requires you to compare Patterson\u2019s allegations with the defendant\u2019s responses, and apply the provisions of Rule 8 as to the effect of a denial, failure to deny, or allegation that the pleader is \u2018\u2018without sufficient facts to form a belief.\u2019\u2019 (Remember, my questions assume that you have the Rule in front of you. I\u2019m not testing whether you remember the provisions of the rule, though your professor might. Rather, the questions test whether you can apply the rules to these allegations and responses.) Naturally, AE has admitted that Adair was its employee, by admitting it! (Sometimes even the pleading rules are commonsensical.) The allegation that Adair was talking on his cell phone is treated as denied: Under the Rule 8(b)(5), the \u2018\u2018without sufficient information\u2019\u2019 response is treated as a denial. Adair hasn\u2019t responded at all to the allegation that Adair acted in the scope of employment at the time of the accident. Frequently, defendants would like to ignore allegations in the complaint, if they aren\u2019t sure of their truth, or it would be awkward to admit them. But this head-in-the-sand strategy doesn\u2019t work under the Rules: Rule 8(b)(6) provides that allegations that are not denied are deemed admitted. So, effectively, AE has admitted that Adair was its employee and that he acted in the scope of employment, but denied negligence and that Adair was chatting on the cell phone. So, B is right.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nRule 8 contains simple, sensible provisions governing the defendant\u2019s responses to the allegations in the complaint. First, Rule 8(b) requires the defendant to admit or deny each of the allegations in the complaint. Usually, this is done paragraph by paragraph. Rule 10(b) requires that averments in the complaint be set forth in separate paragraphs. The defendant, in answering, must take a position on each of these allegations, by admitting those that are true, and denying those that aren\u2019t. Under Rule 8(b)(2), a \u2018\u2018denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.\u2019\u2019 If the defendant means to deny only a part of an allegation, she must specify what is true and deny only the parts that are not. Failing to deny an allegation constitutes an admission of it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6). The idea is that, if the parties plead conscientiously by the Rules, the parties and the court can compare the allegations in the complaint and the responses in the answer, and determine which issues are contested and which are agreed upon (and therefore need not be litigated). If all goes right, this simple pleading process can narrow the scope of the dispute considerably. The Rule also recognizes that the defendant may not know whether some allegations in the complaint are true or not. If she has grounds to deny them, she may do so, but if she just doesn\u2019t know, or doesn\u2019t have the information necessary to admit or deny at the time of pleading, she may respond that she \u2018\u2018lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(5). Under the rule, this response to an allegation \u2018\u2018has the effect of a denial.\u2019\u2019 To determine what issues remain in dispute, of course, the plaintiff\u2014 and the court\u2014have to read the defendant\u2019s answer in light of the provisions of the pleading rules. Consider, for example, what the plaintiff should make of the defendant\u2019s answer in the following case.\n\nQuestion:\n8. Yes, no, and maybe.

So, B is right.\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nSpecial problems arise when the plaintiff seeks to amend to add additional claims, or change the nature of her claims, after the statute of limitations has expired. The rule-makers addressed this problem in Rule 15(c). Let\u2019s start with Rule 15(c)(1), which deals with the most common situation, in which the plaintiff files the complaint within the limitations period, the limitations period passes, and later the plaintiff wants to amend her complaint to add another claim. Rule 15(c)(1) provides: When an Amendment Relates Back. An amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when . . . (B) the amendment asserts a claim or defense that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out\u2014or attempted to be set out\u2014in the original pleading . . . What does it mean that the amendment \u2018\u2018relates back\u2019\u2019 if it arises from the same underlying events alleged in the original pleading? It means that the amended complaint, containing the new claim, will be treated as though it had been filed when the original complaint was filed. What\u2019s the point of this? It is intended to make clear that the statute of limitations is not a defense to new claims in the amended complaint, any more than it was to the original claim. A diagram should help. Assume that Roberts sues Morales for breach of contract, based on the sale of a quantity of men\u2019s suits Morales sold to him on March 15, 2013. He files suit on March 1, 2016, just before the three-year limitations period for contract claims in the relevant jurisdiction runs out. Four months later, he moves to amend his complaint to add an allegation that the sale constituted the tort of fraud, a claim that also has a three-year limitations period. If Roberts had brought no suit until July of 2011, and then sued Morales for fraud, the fraud claim would be barred by the statute of limitations. But here, Roberts did sue Morales for this sale of goods before the passage of the limitations period. All he wants to do now is to add to his complaint another theory of recovery for the sale. Under Rule 15(c)(1) (B), if the amendment is allowed, the fraud claim will be treated as though it had been filed on March 1, 2016, before the statute of limitations passed. Why does the rule allow this bit of legal fiction? The purpose of a statute of limitations is to ensure that the defendant has notice of a claim within a given period of time, so she can adequately prepare to defend that claim. Here, Roberts put Morales on notice that he would have to defend his conduct involving the March 15, 2013 sale when he sued him on March 1, 2011, within the limitations period. Morales should realize, as of that date, that he will have to defend that sale, and gather the evidence to do so before it disappears. True, he thinks he has to defend a contract claim based on the sale, not a fraud claim. But Rule 15(c)(1)(B) reflects the rule-makers\u2019 conclusion that, once a defendant has been put on notice that particular conduct will be litigated\u2014the March 15, 2013 sale\u2014the purpose of the limitations period is satisfied. Consequently, since Roberts sued Morales for the sale before the limitations period ran, Roberts should be allowed to assert whatever claims or theories he has arising from that sale, even if he thinks of additional theories later. Otherwise, Roberts would have to develop his whole case before March 15, 2013, not just sue Morales by that date. Here\u2019s an example to illustrate the point.\n\nQuestion:\n6. Amendment rights? In March 2014, shortly after a new mayor takes office, Harcourt is fired from her job as a City administrator. She sues the City for breach of contract in February 2016, one month before the two-year limitations period passes. The parties conduct discovery over the course of seventeen months. In July 2017, just before the pre-trial conference, Harcourt moves to amend to add a federal civil rights claim to her complaint, alleging that she was fired because she belonged to the outgoing mayor\u2019s party, and that the firing violates her First Amendment rights. A three-year limitations period applies to the civil rights claim. The judge holds a hearing on the motion to amend, and indicates reluctance to allow the motion, because it comes late in the litigation.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nIf the judge denies the amendment, Harcourt will be barred by the statute of limitations from recovering on her civil rights claim.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo B is right. If the judge allows Harcourt\u2019s amendment, she will be allowed to litigate the civil rights claim. If the judge denies the amendment, that claim is lost. Harcourt better have a darn good argument why she didn\u2019t offer this amendment sooner. The question highlights the importance of the judge\u2019s discretionary decision whether to allow an amendment\u2014and one reason why judges have a natural, human inclination to grant them.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThere are some subtle problems in the amendment area. So we have a pre-closer and a closer. A party who sues a defendant on a claim within the limitations period may change theories, add new damages, or recast the factual basis of the claim through amendments, assuming that the amended allegations still are based on the same underlying facts, and that the judge allows the amendment. The amended allegations will \u2018\u2018relate back\u2019\u2019 to the date the original complaint was filed. If the claim asserted in the amended complaint would have been timely on that date, Rule 15(c)(1)(B) avoids any limitations problem. But suppose the amendment adds a new defendant to the case? Rule 15 has a separate, more abstruse provision, Rule 15(c)(1)(C), that deals with this twist. As an example, assume that Leroy sues Tele-Sell, a telemarketing firm, under a statute barring telemarketing calls to consumers who have placed their names on a state do-not-call list. After he sues, the limitations period passes. Several months later, he learns that he was mistaken, that the calls actually came from Tel-Connect, a different firm. Consequently, he moves to amend to substitute Tel- Connect as the defendant. Allowing relation back for an amendment like this, adding a new party, requires a more stringent standard than others, because the new claim is against a different defendant, who was not sued before the limitations period expired. Under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) three requirements must be met before an amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted will \u2018\u2018relate back\u2019\u2019 to the date the original complaint was filed. \u2022 First, the amended pleading must arise out of the same events as the original pleading. Rule 15(c)(1)(C). \u2022 Second, the defendant being added must have \u2018\u2018received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). This notice must have been received within the period of time it would have been received had the new defendant been sued originally. \u2022 Third, the plaintiff must show that the new defendant brought in by the amendment \u2018\u2018knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The first requirement is met in Leroy\u2019s case. He is suing Tel-Connect for the same harassing calls that were the basis of his initial suit against Tele-Sell. But Rule 15(c)(1) requires more than that. It also requires that Tel-Connect was aware, within the period for suing and serving the complaint on Tele-Sell, that the suit had been brought, and that it\u2014Tel- Connect\u2014was actually the intended target of the suit. What\u2019s the point of this complex provision? It is meant to ensure that Tel-Connect, the party Leroy brings in late, had actual notice within the limitations period (plus the additional 90 days that Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) gives for serving the complaint2) that Leroy intended to sue it. If it had such notice, the purpose of the limitations period has been satisfied: The added defendant was aware of the need to preserve evidence and prepare a defense, within the limitations period prescribed by the legislature. Perhaps the following question will help to sort out the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C).\n\nQuestion:\n7. Black and White. Williams is roughed up during an arrest by a police officer and suffers a broken wrist that doesn\u2019t heal right.

Darrow names Black as the defendant. Suit is filed one month before the limitations period runs. In fact, it wasn\u2019t Black who arrested Williams, it was Officer White. The report, filled out by the booking officer, was simply mistaken. Within a few days, every officer in the precinct, including White, became aware that Black had been sued by an arrestee for excessive force, though they were not aware of the specific circumstances of the case or the identity of the plaintiff. Six months later, Black answers interrogatories sent to him by Williams, denying that he was the arresting officer. Darrow investigates, confirms from other witnesses that White was the arresting officer, and moves to amend to name White as the defendant in the action.

It is true that the amendment will not relate back because it was filed after the limitations period had passed. But it is not the best answer.

The judge holds a hearing on the motion to amend, and indicates reluctance to allow the motion, because it comes late in the litigation.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nIf the judge denies the amendment, Harcourt will be barred by the statute of limitations from recovering on her civil rights claim.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo B is right. If the judge allows Harcourt\u2019s amendment, she will be allowed to litigate the civil rights claim. If the judge denies the amendment, that claim is lost. Harcourt better have a darn good argument why she didn\u2019t offer this amendment sooner. The question highlights the importance of the judge\u2019s discretionary decision whether to allow an amendment\u2014and one reason why judges have a natural, human inclination to grant them.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThere are some subtle problems in the amendment area. So we have a pre-closer and a closer. A party who sues a defendant on a claim within the limitations period may change theories, add new damages, or recast the factual basis of the claim through amendments, assuming that the amended allegations still are based on the same underlying facts, and that the judge allows the amendment. The amended allegations will \u2018\u2018relate back\u2019\u2019 to the date the original complaint was filed. If the claim asserted in the amended complaint would have been timely on that date, Rule 15(c)(1)(B) avoids any limitations problem. But suppose the amendment adds a new defendant to the case? Rule 15 has a separate, more abstruse provision, Rule 15(c)(1)(C), that deals with this twist. As an example, assume that Leroy sues Tele-Sell, a telemarketing firm, under a statute barring telemarketing calls to consumers who have placed their names on a state do-not-call list. After he sues, the limitations period passes. Several months later, he learns that he was mistaken, that the calls actually came from Tel-Connect, a different firm. Consequently, he moves to amend to substitute Tel- Connect as the defendant. Allowing relation back for an amendment like this, adding a new party, requires a more stringent standard than others, because the new claim is against a different defendant, who was not sued before the limitations period expired. Under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) three requirements must be met before an amendment changing the party against whom a claim is asserted will \u2018\u2018relate back\u2019\u2019 to the date the original complaint was filed. \u2022 First, the amended pleading must arise out of the same events as the original pleading. Rule 15(c)(1)(C). \u2022 Second, the defendant being added must have \u2018\u2018received such notice of the action that it will not be prejudiced in defending on the merits.\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(i). This notice must have been received within the period of time it would have been received had the new defendant been sued originally. \u2022 Third, the plaintiff must show that the new defendant brought in by the amendment \u2018\u2018knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party\u2019s identity.\u2019\u2019 Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii). The first requirement is met in Leroy\u2019s case. He is suing Tel-Connect for the same harassing calls that were the basis of his initial suit against Tele-Sell. But Rule 15(c)(1) requires more than that. It also requires that Tel-Connect was aware, within the period for suing and serving the complaint on Tele-Sell, that the suit had been brought, and that it\u2014Tel- Connect\u2014was actually the intended target of the suit. What\u2019s the point of this complex provision? It is meant to ensure that Tel-Connect, the party Leroy brings in late, had actual notice within the limitations period (plus the additional 90 days that Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(m) gives for serving the complaint2) that Leroy intended to sue it. If it had such notice, the purpose of the limitations period has been satisfied: The added defendant was aware of the need to preserve evidence and prepare a defense, within the limitations period prescribed by the legislature. Perhaps the following question will help to sort out the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C).\n\nQuestion:\n7. Black and White. Williams is roughed up during an arrest by a police officer and suffers a broken wrist that doesn\u2019t heal right. Williams consults Darrow, a lawyer, who brings a federal civil rights action for his injury. Darrow obtains the police report of the arrest, which lists Officer Black as the arresting officer. Darrow names Black as the defendant. Suit is filed one month before the limitations period runs. In fact, it wasn\u2019t Black who arrested Williams, it was Officer White. The report, filled out by the booking officer, was simply mistaken. Within a few days, every officer in the precinct, including White, became aware that Black had been sued by an arrestee for excessive force, though they were not aware of the specific circumstances of the case or the identity of the plaintiff. Six months later, Black answers interrogatories sent to him by Williams, denying that he was the arresting officer. Darrow investigates, confirms from other witnesses that White was the arresting officer, and moves to amend to name White as the defendant in the action. The amendment, if allowed, will likely\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nnot relate back, because it was filed after the limitations period had passed.\n\nAnalysis:\nA is very close. It is true that the amendment will not relate back because it was filed after the limitations period had passed. But it is not the best answer. It\u2019s a bit sloppy, because it suggests that an amendment to add a party can\u2019t relate back if it is filed after the limitations period has passed. That isn\u2019t so: If the requirements of Rule 15(c)(1)(C) are met, it would be treated as though it had been filed at the time of the original complaint. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nRule 11(c)(2) is often referred to as the \u2018\u2018safe harbor\u2019\u2019 provision of Rule 11. This subsection is intended to limit court time spent on sanctions motions while at the same time providing an incentive to clean up dubious pleadings and other filings. Under Rule 11(c)(2) a party who concludes that allegations in an opponent\u2019s filing are sanctionable may draft a motion for sanctions, citing the offending allegations. However, the moving party does not file the motion with the court; she sends it (presumably, with a supporting memorandum explaining why the challenged allegations are sanctionable) to the offending party. The rule gives the offender 21 days to withdraw or correct the challenged items. If she does, that\u2019s the end of it; the offender has sailed into the safe harbor; the moving party will not file the motion and the court will not impose a sanction. If the offender does not correct or withdraw, then the party who sent the motion files it with the court, which will hear the motion and may not only impose a sanction for submitting the unsupported paper, but may also award the moving party expenses and fees for the motion. The logic of Rule 11(c)(2) is impeccable: Put the party on notice of the unwarranted allegations, let her clean it up or withdraw it, and get on with the real issues in the case without taking the court\u2019s time culling out the frivolous ones. One wonders, however, if the practice matches the theory. How often will a litigator, who after all drafted and submitted the paper, roll over and cry \u2018\u2018mea culpa!\u2019\u2019 when an unloved opponent brands her a rule breaker? It may be that many litigators, who tend to be a feisty lot, will succumb to the temptation to dig in their heels rather than recognize the error of their ways. This would be unfortunate, but one suspects that the aggressive litigator does not always resemble Judge Hand\u2019s Reasonable Person. Here\u2019s an interesting question on the point.\n\nQuestion:\n6. The unsafe harbor. Withers sues Rendoso in federal court in East Dakota for negligent indirect infliction of emotional distress, claiming that he suffered severe distress from witnessing an accident in which a friend was seriously injured. Rendoso moves to dismiss the claim under Rule 12(b) (6) for failure to state a claim, citing two recent cases from the East Dakota Supreme Court that quite clearly limit the right to recover for indirect infliction to close family members. The court enters an order dismissing the claim. Rendoso now moves for sanctions under Rule 11(b)(2), on the ground that the legal position taken in Withers\u2019s complaint was frivolous. The court will likely\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ndeny the motion, because Rendoso failed to draft a motion for sanctions and send it to Withers as required by Rule 11(c)(2).\n\nAnalysis:\nChoose A.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nRule 11(c)(2) is often referred to as the \u2018\u2018safe harbor\u2019\u2019 provision of Rule 11.

The court will likely\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ngrant the motion, because Rendoso challenged the validity of the claim by moving to dismiss it under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\nAnalysis:\nC should fail, and does. There\u2019s a difference between challenging the position taken in a pleading on its merits and challenging it as sanctionable conduct. Here, Rendoso did the former but not the latter. He did not ask for sanctions when the complaint was filed or before he moved to dismiss it. When he wins on the merits he decides to seek sanctions for what went before. The court is likely to hold, as most courts apparently do, that Rendoso\u2019s failure to use the \u2018\u2018safe harbor\u2019\u2019 provision to challenge the claim precludes him from seeking sanctions later on. See Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71337.2. If Withers had sent a motion under Rule 11(c)(2), Rendoso might have seen the error of his ways and withdrawn the claim, saving time and expense for everyone. Withers cannot circumvent this procedure by waiting until the court expends time addressing the questionable claim and then filing a motion for sanctions directly with the court. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nConsider the dilemma for the drafters of Rule 11 when establishing ethical limits on asserting legal positions before the court. Surely, they don\u2019t want to prevent lawyers from arguing for legal positions that have not been recognized before. Then the law could never change, because lawyers would be subject to sanctions for arguing for change. Surely, the rule makers also would not want to bar lawyers from arguing for the overruling of established law, for the same reason. But they do want to rein in extravagant or outlandish legal arguments that waste the courts\u2019 time. Rule 11(b) walks this line by requiring that there be a \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous argument\u2019\u2019 for legal positions that are not currently recognized or would require the court to overrule current law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), an advocate certifies to the court that the legal positions taken in a pleading, motion or other paper are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), the party asserting a legal position must have a rational argument for the position asserted, a position that has not been definitively rejected by the courts of the jurisdiction so recently that nothing but obstinacy would lead a lawyer to try again. Such \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous\u2019\u2019 arguments might be based on precedents from other states, dissenting opinions, changes by the appellate courts of the relevant state in related areas of law, scholarly criticism of the current law, or other authority suggesting that change is warranted. If you are going to file a pleading, motion, or other paper that argues for a change in the law, but don\u2019t want to risk Rule 11 sanctions, think of it this way: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going out on a limb here. My position is contradicted by the cases. If the judge calls me in before the bench and asks why I should not be sanctioned for violating Rule 11(b)(2), what will I say?\u2019\u2019 You need to be ready with a credible explanation why your argument for change is justified by precedent or other authority. You might say, \u2018\u2018Yes, your honor, I know that I\u2019m arguing to overrule Flores v. Jones, the case on point from our state supreme court, but the Third Restatement of Torts now takes the position I advocate, and four states have recently adopted it.\u2019\u2019 Or, \u2018\u2018Yes, your Honor, I know our state supreme court ruled otherwise in 1934, but look at how many areas of tort law they have modified since. Recognizing this cause of action is supported by our court\u2019s consistent expansion of tort remedies for negligence, reflected in the following seven cases.\u2019\u2019 Arguments like those are \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous.\u2019\u2019 The advocate is not just saying, \u2018\u2018I think the law should be otherwise,\u2019\u2019 but pointing to legal authority that supports the argument. This is reasoned persuasive argument rather than stubborn refusal to face the music. Courts should not prevent that, and Rule 11(b) (2) does not either. Consider this question on the point.\n\nQuestion:\n3. Fighting an uphill battle.

As a practical matter, some very able lawyers might push the Rule 11 bounds for a client in desperate need. They feel that they have to do all they can for such a client, not because they expect to win but because the client so clearly needs recovery.

But even without that, it seems a fair argument to make. \u2018\u2018Court, you have recognized that indirect victims suffer from a traumatic event like this; here\u2019s another sufferer deserving of compensation.\u2019\u2019 The argument may not prevail, but it does not seem frivolous to give it a try. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she\u2019s been sued in the wrong court is to protest. You\u2019d feel the same way. \u2018\u2018Hey, wait! This case doesn\u2019t belong here; throw it out.\u2019\u2019 All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court\u2019s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019 The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have \u2018\u2018appeared generally,\u2019\u2019 waiving her special appearance and accepting the court\u2019s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \u2018\u2018special appearance\u2019\u2019 had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\u2019s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\u2019s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction.

See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \u2018\u2018special appearance\u2019\u2019 had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\u2019s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\u2019s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction.

The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019 The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.

Thus, even if Ito has no minimum contacts with Nevada, and there is no other basis for suing him there, his counsel\u2019s in- court conduct of arguing to the merits constitutes a voluntary submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Unlike an objection to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, the personal jurisdiction objection may be waived.

For example, a lawyer might be asked to produce a statement she had taken from a witness to the events in suit, or an index she had made of a file containing large numbers of documents in a client\u2019s possession, or a memo to a partner stating which documents in the client\u2019s files were relevant to the opposing party\u2019s claim. Such documents, created in the course of representation and for the purpose of preparing the case, are clearly relevant to the issues in the case, under Rule 26(b)(1). Yet allowing discovery of these materials would severely impact lawyers\u2019 practices, since they could reveal counsel\u2019s case evaluation and trial strategy to the opposing party. In Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947), the Supreme Court held that such \u2018\u2018attorney work product\u2019\u2019 should be protected from disclosure, at least absent a showing of a particular need for the information and inability to obtain it through other means. The Court was concerned that discovery of trial preparation materials would interfere with lawyers\u2019 ability to develop their case strategy in private, and lead lawyers to build their cases by forcing disclosure of opposing counsel\u2019s efforts rather than undertaking their own. Thus, the Court created a limited objection to shield work product materials from discovery. This is an additional limit on access to materials, even if they satisfy the broad relevance standard in Rule 26(b)(1). In 1970, Rule 26(b)(3), entitled \u2018\u2018Trial Preparation: Materials\u2019\u2019 was added to the Federal Rules. That Rule partially codifies the protection Hickman provided to work product materials. Under Rule 26(b)(3), trial preparation materials are protected from discovery if three criteria are met. The materials must be \u2018\u2018documents or tangible things.\u2019\u2019 They must be \u2018\u2018prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial,\u2019\u2019 and they must be prepared \u2018\u2018by or for another party or its representative. . . .\u2019\u2019 If these criteria are met, the materials need not ordinarily be produced in discovery. So, the first issue to consider in analyzing a claim of work product protection is whether the materials are presumptively protected. That depends on the three criteria in Rule 26(b)(3)(A). Not all documents in the possession of a lawyer are trial preparation materials. Suppose, for example, that Jackson is defending the City police department on a charge of unlawful arrest, and the chief of police sends him a copy of the booking sheet concerning the arrest and the arresting officer\u2019s report about the incident that gave rise to the arrest. These are not trial preparation materials. They are \u2018\u2018documents or tangible things,\u2019\u2019 and they are prepared by or for another party (the police department) but they are not \u2018\u2018prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\u2019\u2019 They are simply the general business records of the police department, made as a matter of routine in every case, whether litigation may follow or not. Although they were sent to counsel in the course of defending the case, that is not enough to make them work product. If it were, all documents would be shielded from discovery simply because they were sent to counsel. If a document meets the criteria for work product under Rule 26(b) (3)(A), the presumptive protection for such materials may still be overcome in some circumstances. Under the rule, the court may order production of protected materials if the party seeking them shows that it has \u2018\u2018substantial need for the materials to prepare its case\u2019\u2019 and cannot obtain their substantial equivalent by other means. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3)(A)(ii). However, even if the requesting party cannot otherwise obtain the material, some items may not be discoverable under Rule 26(b)(3). Work product need not be produced, even if a substantial need is shown, if it would reveal \u2018\u2018the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party\u2019s attorney or other representative concerning the litigation.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(B). It may be helpful to think of Rule 26(b)(3) in terms of a decision tree: Step #1: Is the material a document or tangible thing? Was it prepared by or for another party? Was it prepared in anticipation of litigation? If the answer to these questions is \u2018\u2018yes,\u2019\u2019 the document enjoys presumptive protection under Rule 26(b)(3). Then go on to Step #2. Step #2: Does the requesting party have a substantial need for the material in preparing its case? Is it unable to obtain equivalent information by other means? If the answer to both questions is \u2018\u2018yes,\u2019\u2019 it will have to be produced despite presumptive work product protection. . . . unless . . . Step #3: Would the material reveal the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of counsel? If yes, such opinions, etc., will be protected from discovery in almost all cases, despite surviving Steps #1 and #2. This protection for trial preparation materials in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3) is usually referred to as the \u2018\u2018work product doctrine,\u2019\u2019 or the \u2018\u2018protection for trial preparation material,\u2019\u2019 rather than as a privilege. This reflects the fact that work product protection, unlike a privilege, can be outweighed, under Hickman or under Rule 26(b)(3), by a sufficient showing of need. But the doctrine is loosely referred to as a privilege in a good many opinions, and in at least some situations it is treated as one. Consider, in the following example, whether the material requested satisfies the Rule 26(b)(3) standard for \u2018\u2018trial preparation materials.\u2019\u2019\n\nQuestion:\n6. Eager anticipation. Leahy Pharmaceuticals receives a series of complaints about its \u2018\u2018Nasa-Clean\u2019\u2019 nasal spray. One letter, from counsel for Wallace, demands compensation for injuries Wallace allegedly sustained from using the spray, and threatens suit if compensation is not provided. Leahy officers doubt that Nasa-Clean caused Wallace\u2019s injuries. In order to determine whether to settle or litigate the claim, they ask Friedan, a chemist who works for the company, to review relevant records regarding the spray to determine whether it had caused similar injuries to other users. Friedan submits a written report on her investigation to Leahy. Four months later, Wallace brings suit in federal court against Leahy for his injuries and requests production of all documents and reports in Leahy\u2019s possession concerning problems with Nasa-Clean. Friedan\u2019s report\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nis protected from discovery under Rule 26(b)(3), unless Wallace makes a showing of substantial need and inability to obtain equivalent information through other means.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo, A is the best answer. The report is protected under Rule 26(b)(3), so long as the court concludes that it was prepared in anticipation of litigation.3 Unless Wallace makes the showing of special need and inability to obtain the material in other ways, the report need not be produced. That does not, however, protect the underlying material that Friedan examined in investigating the claim. For example, Leahy could not raise a work product objection to a Request for Production of Documents seeking \u2018\u2018all complaints received by the defendant concerning Nasa- Clean\u2019\u2019 for a reasonable period of time. Indeed, such a request would likely be a reasonable alternative way of getting the information in Friedan\u2019s report, which suggests that Wallace would be unable to overcome the presumptive protection of Rule 26(b)(3).\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nWhen the Federal Rules were adopted in 1938, they contained no provision dealing with discovery of \u2018\u2018work product,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018trial preparation materials.\u2019\u2019 However, as the federal courts gained experience with the broad right to discovery introduced by the Rules, they were frequently called upon to protect documents developed in the course of representation by lawyers or their agents. For example, a lawyer might be asked to produce a statement she had taken from a witness to the events in suit, or an index she had made of a file containing large numbers of documents in a client\u2019s possession, or a memo to a partner stating which documents in the client\u2019s files were relevant to the opposing party\u2019s claim. Such documents, created in the course of representation and for the purpose of preparing the case, are clearly relevant to the issues in the case, under Rule 26(b)(1). Yet allowing discovery of these materials would severely impact lawyers\u2019 practices, since they could reveal counsel\u2019s case evaluation and trial strategy to the opposing party. In Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495 (1947), the Supreme Court held that such \u2018\u2018attorney work product\u2019\u2019 should be protected from disclosure, at least absent a showing of a particular need for the information and inability to obtain it through other means. The Court was concerned that discovery of trial preparation materials would interfere with lawyers\u2019 ability to develop their case strategy in private, and lead lawyers to build their cases by forcing disclosure of opposing counsel\u2019s efforts rather than undertaking their own. Thus, the Court created a limited objection to shield work product materials from discovery. This is an additional limit on access to materials, even if they satisfy the broad relevance standard in Rule 26(b)(1). In 1970, Rule 26(b)(3), entitled \u2018\u2018Trial Preparation: Materials\u2019\u2019 was added to the Federal Rules. That Rule partially codifies the protection Hickman provided to work product materials. Under Rule 26(b)(3), trial preparation materials are protected from discovery if three criteria are met. The materials must be \u2018\u2018documents or tangible things.\u2019\u2019 They must be \u2018\u2018prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial,\u2019\u2019 and they must be prepared \u2018\u2018by or for another party or its representative. . . .\u2019\u2019 If these criteria are met, the materials need not ordinarily be produced in discovery. So, the first issue to consider in analyzing a claim of work product protection is whether the materials are presumptively protected. That depends on the three criteria in Rule 26(b)(3)(A). Not all documents in the possession of a lawyer are trial preparation materials. Suppose, for example, that Jackson is defending the City police department on a charge of unlawful arrest, and the chief of police sends him a copy of the booking sheet concerning the arrest and the arresting officer\u2019s report about the incident that gave rise to the arrest. These are not trial preparation materials. They are \u2018\u2018documents or tangible things,\u2019\u2019 and they are prepared by or for another party (the police department) but they are not \u2018\u2018prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.\u2019\u2019 They are simply the general business records of the police department, made as a matter of routine in every case, whether litigation may follow or not. Although they were sent to counsel in the course of defending the case, that is not enough to make them work product. If it were, all documents would be shielded from discovery simply because they were sent to counsel. If a document meets the criteria for work product under Rule 26(b) (3)(A), the presumptive protection for such materials may still be overcome in some circumstances. Under the rule, the court may order production of protected materials if the party seeking them shows that it has \u2018\u2018substantial need for the materials to prepare its case\u2019\u2019 and cannot obtain their substantial equivalent by other means. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b) (3)(A)(ii). However, even if the requesting party cannot otherwise obtain the material, some items may not be discoverable under Rule 26(b)(3). Work product need not be produced, even if a substantial need is shown, if it would reveal \u2018\u2018the mental impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of a party\u2019s attorney or other representative concerning the litigation.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(3)(B). It may be helpful to think of Rule 26(b)(3) in terms of a decision tree: Step #1: Is the material a document or tangible thing? Was it prepared by or for another party?

Presumptuous presumptions. Mason sues Drake in federal court for negligently causing a fire in her warehouse in Boston. A week after the fire, Mason\u2019s attorney locates and interviews Collins, who was drinking wine behind the warehouse at the time of the fire. Collins says he and Engels saw someone who looked like Drake speed away from the fire just after it began. Mason\u2019s counsel made an audio recording of the interview with Collins. Collins lives in Boston, within the district in which the suit is pending. Drake\u2019s attorney had asked Collins to come in to discuss the case informally with him, but Collins refused. Drake serves interrogatories on Mason asking Mason to \u2018\u2018state the names of any witnesses who may have knowledge of the events giving rise to this action.\u2019\u2019 He also sends a request for documents, which requires Mason to \u2018\u2018produce any statements you or your attorney have from any witness regarding the cause of the fire.\u2019\u2019 Mason\u2019s counsel responds by objecting to both the interrogatory and the request on the ground of \u2018\u2018work product.\u2019\u2019 Which of the following statements is true?\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nMason may refuse to answer the interrogatory and to produce the tape, based on the work product doctrine.\n\nAnalysis:\nDrake has requested two items: the names of witnesses to the litigation events and the statement of one witness taken by opposing counsel. Let\u2019s consider the witness list first. Mason\u2019s counsel cannot protect the names of witnesses he is aware of simply because he learned of them in the course of trial preparation. But why not? Isn\u2019t this \u2018\u2018work product,\u2019\u2019 in the sense that he unearthed the names of these witnesses through his trial preparation efforts? Well, in a sense this is \u2018\u2018trial preparation material\u2019\u2019; it is information Mason\u2019s counsel has learned in the course of preparing the case. However, the protection does not apply to everything an attorney knows or learns. It applies, under Rule 26(b)(3) to \u2018\u2018documents and tangible things\u2019\u2019 created during trial preparation, and attorneys\u2019 strategic musings, but not to the facts those documents contain. Even though Mason\u2019s counsel discovered these facts himself while developing his case, this will not shield the information from discovery. Mason\u2019s lawyer is his agent, and his knowledge of facts about the case will be attributed to Mason. Thus, when Mason answers the interrogatory (and it is the client, not the lawyer, who signs the answers), he will have to include responsive information developed by his lawyer about the case. So A is wrong; Mason must answer the interrogatory requesting the names of relevant witnesses. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nWhen the Federal Rules were adopted in 1938, they contained no provision dealing with discovery of \u2018\u2018work product,\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018trial preparation materials.\u2019\u2019 However, as the federal courts gained experience with the broad right to discovery introduced by the Rules, they were frequently called upon to protect documents developed in the course of representation by lawyers or their agents.

Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties\u2019 relative access to relevant information, the parties\u2019 resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of \u2018\u2018any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.\u2019\u2019 In an effort to rein in discovery, the \u2018\u2018relevant to the claim or defense of any party\u2019\u2019 language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to \u2018\u2018the subject matter of the pending action,\u2019\u2019 but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called \u2018\u2018proportionality factors\u2019\u2019 in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the \u2018\u2018relevant to a claim or defense in the action\u2019\u2019 standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff\u2019s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants\u2019 arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is discoverable even though it isn\u2019t admissible as evidence at a trial. \u2018\u2018Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\u2019\u2019 For example, statements that are \u2018\u2018hearsay,\u2019\u2019 that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here\u2019s a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).\n\nQuestion:\n1. Time past and time future. Karim sues Precision Machine Company after she suffers a serious injury to her hand using a stamping machine manufactured by Precision. Her suit is brought after the statute of limitations on a strict products liability claim has expired, so her complaint alleges negligence by Precision in the design of the machine. Karim\u2019s counsel sends an interrogatory to Precision asking whether, at any time between the accident and the present, it has added a safety guard to the machine that injured Karim (which it has). Under the relevant rules of evidence, evidence of such \u2018\u2018subsequent remedial measures\u2019\u2019 is not admissible in an action to establish that the defendant was negligent in failing to take a similar precaution before the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The purpose of this rule of evidence is to encourage defendants to eliminate unsafe conditions, without fear that such safety measures will be introduced at trial to establish liability for not taking those measures before. The information sought in the interrogatory\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nis within the scope of discovery under the current standard in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).\n\nAnalysis:\nD is the best answer. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nA good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General.

The purpose of this rule of evidence is to encourage defendants to eliminate unsafe conditions, without fear that such safety measures will be introduced at trial to establish liability for not taking those measures before. The information sought in the interrogatory\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nis not within the scope of discovery, because evidence of subsequent remedial repairs is inadmissible at trial under the relevant rules of evidence.\n\nAnalysis:\nA is pretty much a throwaway. Rule 26(b)(1) explicitly provides that information is discoverable, even if it could not be admitted into evidence at trial, if it meets the broad relevance standard in the rule. The idea is that information might assist a party in developing her case, even though it could not be presented at trial. This is manifestly true in many cases. For example, the hearsay statement \u2018\u2018I heard Smith say that a Federal Express delivery man drove away after the accident\u2019\u2019 might be inadmissible hearsay. But this information could clearly assist the plaintiff in finding an important witness. Similarly, in an assault case, evidence that a witness had heard of instances of violence by the defendant would likely be inadmissible hearsay, yet could lead to the discovery of evidence of violent conduct that could be used to impeach the defendant\u2019s testimony about who started a fight. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nIf a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement? Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This \u2018\u2018aggregation\u2019\u2019 problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot \u2018\u2018aggregate\u2019\u2019 claims against different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a \u2018\u2018common, undivided interest.\u2019\u2019 (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at Chapter 14, pp. 279-283.

As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.\n\nQuestion:\n10. Aggravation of damages. Maurice sues O\u2019Connell in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, seeking recovery on a libel claim for $25,000 and an unrelated negligence claim, for $65,000. He also joins Parker as a codefendant on the negligence claim, seeking his $65,000 in negligence damages from Parker. Assume that Maurice\u2019s claims do not involve a \u2018\u2018common undivided interest.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nMaurice does not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement against Parker, but does against O\u2019Connell.\n\nAnalysis:\nA is correct. Maurice meets the amount requirement against O\u2019Connell, by adding his two unrelated claims against him. But he cannot add Parker as a codefendant, since he seeks less than $75,000.01 in damages from him. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nIf a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement? Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This \u2018\u2018aggregation\u2019\u2019 problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot \u2018\u2018aggregate\u2019\u2019 claims against different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a \u2018\u2018common, undivided interest.\u2019\u2019 (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not.

The Federal Rules now contain several provisions to assist judges in handling the problems posed by electronic discovery: \u2022 Rules 33(d) and 34(a)(1)(A) expressly provide that \u2018\u2018electronically stored information\u2019\u2019 is subject to discovery.

Because parties often produce huge masses of material in electronic discovery exchanges, they will sometimes discover that, without meaning to, they have produced documents that were privileged or subject to work product protection. Rule 26(b)(5)(B) allows a party who has made such an \u2018\u2018inadvertent disclosure\u2019\u2019 to notify the receiving party of the mistake. If so notified, the receiving party must promptly return, sequester, or destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must not use or disclose the information until the claim is resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the information if the party disclosed it before being notified; and may promptly present the information to the court under seal for a determination of the claim [of privilege or work product protection]. The producing party must preserve the information until the claim is resolved. This provision attempts to freeze the status quo until the producing party\u2019s claim of privilege can be resolved.

Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(1)(B). Thus, the party answering the interrogatories must make a reasonable inquiry to obtain the information requested. By contrast, a deponent will generally answer at a deposition based solely on personal knowledge. If a party believes that the information sought is not within the scope of discovery, or is protected from disclosure, the party should respond by objecting to the interrogatory. For example, if an interrogatory asked for all statements taken from any witness, the responding party could object based on work product protection under Rule 26(b)(3). The responding party signs the interrogatories under oath, but any objections raised are to be signed by the attorney making them. Rule 33(b)(5). This emphasizes that it is the lawyers who interpose legal objections to discovery (and, consequently, may be sanctioned if such objections are not justified). Which is the proper response to the interrogatory below?  interrogatories, depositions, and requests for production of documents have been available under the Federal Rules since their adoption in 1938. Interrogatories are simply questions, sent by one party to the case to be answered by another. (They may not be used to obtain information from nonparties.) A major advantage of interrogatories is that they are inexpensive. You just write them and send them, and hopefully get useful information back in the answers. However, the answers are not spontaneous; they are written by the responding party\u2019s lawyer, who, as an advocate for the opposing party, tends to construe interrogatories narrowly and respond with as little information as possible. Interrogatories should be precise and specific, in order to get something precise and specific in return. Thus they are best used to obtain objective factual information such as names of witnesses, itemizations of damages, dates of relevant events, and the location of known documents. This type of information can be clearly described in an interrogatory, in a manner that is not subject to a limiting construction by opposing counsel. For more subjective inquiries, interrogatories tend to produce unsatisfying results. A long-running source of debate has been the extent to which parties may ask interrogatories that call for opinions or contentions. For example, an interrogatory might ask the plaintiff in a contracts case to specify \u2018\u2018each act upon which the plaintiff relies in support of her contention that the defendant breached the contract.\u2019\u2019 This is not a purely factual question, like \u2018\u2018Please state where the meeting between Smith and Jones took place.\u2019\u2019 Instead, such \u2018\u2018contention interrogatories\u2019\u2019 call for the application of law to fact, for the party to provide factual support for a position taken in the pleadings. Rule 33(a)(2) confirms that such interrogatories are proper, though the court may allow a party to defer answering them until discovery is complete: An interrogatory is not objectionable merely because it asks for an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that the interrogatory need not be answered until designated discovery is complete, or until a pretrial conference or some other time. Such contention interrogatories provide a means for opponents to gain an understanding of the factual basis for general allegations in the pleadings. Consider the interrogatory in the following example.  \n\nQuestion:\n5. Reasonable inquiry. Melchior brings a products liability action in federal court against Atmosphere Aviation Corporation, a national airline. She seeks damages for personal injuries suffered in the crash of an Atmosphere plane. She also sues General Engines Corporation, which manufactured the engines on the plane. General Engines has offices in five states. Atmosphere Aviation sends interrogatories to General Engines, requesting it to list all reports it has in its possession concerning accidents over the last ten years involving the type of engine involved in the crash, and the names of the persons conducting those investigations. Branch, the vice president for operations of General Engines, is designated to respond to the interrogatories for the corporation. While Branch oversees all General\u2019s operations, she does not have all the information sought by the interrogatory; much of it is located in files in offices at other corporate locations. Branch should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nconduct an investigation to determine what relevant documents General has, and answer based on that investigation.\n\nAnalysis:\nChoose A. You can imagine how enthusiastic Branch will be about conducting that investigation. At the very least, it is a major distraction from her job; at worst, it can be an enormous burden leading to production of lots of damaging evidence. In some cases, interrogatories may be objectionable on the ground that the burden of responding is too great or that they require the responding party to conduct analyses or gather information that the requesting party should obtain itself. But here, the request probably is not unduly burdensome, since the interrogatory describes precisely the documents to be listed, and there are not likely to be huge numbers of such reports.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe general learning is that interrogatories do not provide much useful information, since they are not answered spontaneously, but labored over by grudging lawyers trying to protect their clients\u2019 interests.

Interrogatories are simply questions, sent by one party to the case to be answered by another. (They may not be used to obtain information from nonparties.) A major advantage of interrogatories is that they are inexpensive. You just write them and send them, and hopefully get useful information back in the answers. However, the answers are not spontaneous; they are written by the responding party\u2019s lawyer, who, as an advocate for the opposing party, tends to construe interrogatories narrowly and respond with as little information as possible. Interrogatories should be precise and specific, in order to get something precise and specific in return. Thus they are best used to obtain objective factual information such as names of witnesses, itemizations of damages, dates of relevant events, and the location of known documents. This type of information can be clearly described in an interrogatory, in a manner that is not subject to a limiting construction by opposing counsel. For more subjective inquiries, interrogatories tend to produce unsatisfying results. A long-running source of debate has been the extent to which parties may ask interrogatories that call for opinions or contentions. For example, an interrogatory might ask the plaintiff in a contracts case to specify \u2018\u2018each act upon which the plaintiff relies in support of her contention that the defendant breached the contract.\u2019\u2019 This is not a purely factual question, like \u2018\u2018Please state where the meeting between Smith and Jones took place.\u2019\u2019 Instead, such \u2018\u2018contention interrogatories\u2019\u2019 call for the application of law to fact, for the party to provide factual support for a position taken in the pleadings. Rule 33(a)(2) confirms that such interrogatories are proper, though the court may allow a party to defer answering them until discovery is complete: An interrogatory is not objectionable merely because it asks for an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that the interrogatory need not be answered until designated discovery is complete, or until a pretrial conference or some other time. Such contention interrogatories provide a means for opponents to gain an understanding of the factual basis for general allegations in the pleadings. Consider the interrogatory in the following example.  \n\nQuestion:\n5. Reasonable inquiry. Melchior brings a products liability action in federal court against Atmosphere Aviation Corporation, a national airline. She seeks damages for personal injuries suffered in the crash of an Atmosphere plane. She also sues General Engines Corporation, which manufactured the engines on the plane. General Engines has offices in five states. Atmosphere Aviation sends interrogatories to General Engines, requesting it to list all reports it has in its possession concerning accidents over the last ten years involving the type of engine involved in the crash, and the names of the persons conducting those investigations. Branch, the vice president for operations of General Engines, is designated to respond to the interrogatories for the corporation. While Branch oversees all General\u2019s operations, she does not have all the information sought by the interrogatory; much of it is located in files in offices at other corporate locations. Branch should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nconduct an investigation to determine what relevant documents General has, and answer based on that investigation.\n\nAnalysis:\nChoose A. You can imagine how enthusiastic Branch will be about conducting that investigation. At the very least, it is a major distraction from her job; at worst, it can be an enormous burden leading to production of lots of damaging evidence. In some cases, interrogatories may be objectionable on the ground that the burden of responding is too great or that they require the responding party to conduct analyses or gather information that the requesting party should obtain itself. But here, the request probably is not unduly burdensome, since the interrogatory describes precisely the documents to be listed, and there are not likely to be huge numbers of such reports.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe general learning is that interrogatories do not provide much useful information, since they are not answered spontaneously, but labored over by grudging lawyers trying to protect their clients\u2019 interests. But in one respect they can be more effective than depositions. An interrogatory to a corporate party requires the party \u2018\u2018to furnish such information as is available to the party,\u2019\u2019 (emphasis added) not just information that the person answering them personally knows. Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(1)(B). Thus, the party answering the interrogatories must make a reasonable inquiry to obtain the information requested. By contrast, a deponent will generally answer at a deposition based solely on personal knowledge. If a party believes that the information sought is not within the scope of discovery, or is protected from disclosure, the party should respond by objecting to the interrogatory. For example, if an interrogatory asked for all statements taken from any witness, the responding party could object based on work product protection under Rule 26(b)(3). The responding party signs the interrogatories under oath, but any objections raised are to be signed by the attorney making them. Rule 33(b)(5).

If so, which claims? The governing rule in federal court is simple: Fed. R. Civ. P. 18(a): Joinder of Claims. A party asserting a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim may join, as independent or alternate claims, as many claims, as it has against an opposing party. This is clear and comprehensive: When Amos sues Boris in federal court for a fraud claim, Boris is an \u2018\u2018opposing party\u2019\u2019; that is, he\u2019s on the other side of the \u2018\u2018v.\u2019\u2019 So Amos can assert \u2018\u2018as many claims . . . as [he] has\u2019\u2019 against Boris. Consider the application of Rule 18(a) in the following example.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Potpourri. Felina, a real estate agent, sues Pai, who owns the real estate agency where she worked. She sues in federal court, for violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. She claims that Pai discharged her from the agency because of her age, and seeks $100,000 in money damages. She also asserts, in the same complaint against Pai, a claim that she and Pai were informal partners in a venture to buy a large piece of open land, and that Pai took title to the land in her own name only, in violation of their contract. She seeks specific performance of the contract, through an order to convey a half interest in the property to her. Last she seeks compensatory and punitive damages from Pai for breach of her fiduciary duty as a partner in the land deal.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nJoinder of the three claims is proper.\n\nAnalysis:\nRule 18(a) says that a party may join \u2018\u2018as many claims as it has\u2019\u2019 against the opposing party. It doesn\u2019t say anything about suing for the same type of relief. It doesn\u2019t say that the plaintiff can only join claims if they arise from the same underlying transaction or occurrence. It says anything may be joined . . . so why shouldn\u2019t you believe it? D is right. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe purpose of the summary judgment motion is to challenge a party\u2019s ability to prove an allegation in the pleadings. The moving party supports her motion by submitting evidence that, if uncontradicted, would establish the claim or defense she asserts. To avoid summary judgment, the opposing party then must come forward with evidence showing that she has contradictory evidence. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). But suppose the party opposing the motion doesn\u2019t produce such evidence? Consider how the judge should rule on the summary judgment motion in this case.\n\nQuestion:\n6. Inherent contradiction. Fuentes, the beneficiary of a life insurance policy owned by Carello, sues Reliable Insurance to collect the proceeds of the policy. Before answering the complaint, Reliable files a motion for summary judgment. Its ground for the motion is that Carello, who was seriously ill, committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills, and it is therefor not liable on the policy. (As a matter of law, it would not be liable if this is true.) Reliable attaches the affidavit of Allen to the motion. Allen\u2019s affidavit states that on the day before he died, Carello told her that he was miserable, that he couldn\u2019t get any rest due to pain caused by his illness, and that he was glad he had a full bottle of sleeping pills. Assume that Fuentes files no affidavit or other admissible evidence in opposition to the motion. The trial judge should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ngrant the motion, because Fuentes has failed to respond to it with supporting materials, as required by Rule 56(c)(1).\n\nAnalysis:\nAt first glance, it seems that B is right. Rule 56(c)(1) states that when a summary judgment motion is made and supported as required under Rule 56, the opposing party must produce opposing evidence to show that there is a dispute of fact for the jury to consider. Here, Fuentes has not produced any evidence to contradict Allen\u2019s affidavit. However, summary judgment still is not warranted if the moving party\u2019s materials\u2014here, Reliable\u2019s\u2014do not suffice to establish the issue of fact on which the motion is based. If Reliable\u2019s materials do not establish that there is no dispute of fact as to whether Carello committed suicide, summary judgment should be denied, even if Fuentes did not submit materials to contradict Reliable\u2019s evidence.

If Reliable\u2019s materials do not establish that there is no dispute of fact as to whether Carello committed suicide, summary judgment should be denied, even if Fuentes did not submit materials to contradict Reliable\u2019s evidence. So B is wrong; Reliable does not win automatically simply on the procedural ground that Fuentes failed to file opposing evidence. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nLet\u2019s start with the easiest question: if a plaintiff wants to sue a defendant on a claim, can she also assert other claims against the defendant? If so, which claims? The governing rule in federal court is simple: Fed. R. Civ. P. 18(a): Joinder of Claims. A party asserting a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim may join, as independent or alternate claims, as many claims, as it has against an opposing party. This is clear and comprehensive: When Amos sues Boris in federal court for a fraud claim, Boris is an \u2018\u2018opposing party\u2019\u2019; that is, he\u2019s on the other side of the \u2018\u2018v.\u2019\u2019 So Amos can assert \u2018\u2018as many claims . . . as [he] has\u2019\u2019 against Boris. Consider the application of Rule 18(a) in the following example.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Potpourri. Felina, a real estate agent, sues Pai, who owns the real estate agency where she worked. She sues in federal court, for violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. She claims that Pai discharged her from the agency because of her age, and seeks $100,000 in money damages. She also asserts, in the same complaint against Pai, a claim that she and Pai were informal partners in a venture to buy a large piece of open land, and that Pai took title to the land in her own name only, in violation of their contract. She seeks specific performance of the contract, through an order to convey a half interest in the property to her. Last she seeks compensatory and punitive damages from Pai for breach of her fiduciary duty as a partner in the land deal.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nJoinder of the three claims is proper.\n\nAnalysis:\nRule 18(a) says that a party may join \u2018\u2018as many claims as it has\u2019\u2019 against the opposing party. It doesn\u2019t say anything about suing for the same type of relief. It doesn\u2019t say that the plaintiff can only join claims if they arise from the same underlying transaction or occurrence. It says anything may be joined . . . so why shouldn\u2019t you believe it? D is right. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe purpose of the summary judgment motion is to challenge a party\u2019s ability to prove an allegation in the pleadings. The moving party supports her motion by submitting evidence that, if uncontradicted, would establish the claim or defense she asserts. To avoid summary judgment, the opposing party then must come forward with evidence showing that she has contradictory evidence. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). But suppose the party opposing the motion doesn\u2019t produce such evidence? Consider how the judge should rule on the summary judgment motion in this case.\n\nQuestion:\n6. Inherent contradiction. Fuentes, the beneficiary of a life insurance policy owned by Carello, sues Reliable Insurance to collect the proceeds of the policy. Before answering the complaint, Reliable files a motion for summary judgment. Its ground for the motion is that Carello, who was seriously ill, committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills, and it is therefor not liable on the policy. (As a matter of law, it would not be liable if this is true.) Reliable attaches the affidavit of Allen to the motion. Allen\u2019s affidavit states that on the day before he died, Carello told her that he was miserable, that he couldn\u2019t get any rest due to pain caused by his illness, and that he was glad he had a full bottle of sleeping pills. Assume that Fuentes files no affidavit or other admissible evidence in opposition to the motion. The trial judge should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ngrant the motion, because Fuentes has failed to respond to it with supporting materials, as required by Rule 56(c)(1).\n\nAnalysis:\nAt first glance, it seems that B is right. Rule 56(c)(1) states that when a summary judgment motion is made and supported as required under Rule 56, the opposing party must produce opposing evidence to show that there is a dispute of fact for the jury to consider. Here, Fuentes has not produced any evidence to contradict Allen\u2019s affidavit. However, summary judgment still is not warranted if the moving party\u2019s materials\u2014here, Reliable\u2019s\u2014do not suffice to establish the issue of fact on which the motion is based. If Reliable\u2019s materials do not establish that there is no dispute of fact as to whether Carello committed suicide, summary judgment should be denied, even if Fuentes did not submit materials to contradict Reliable\u2019s evidence. So B is wrong; Reliable does not win automatically simply on the procedural ground that Fuentes failed to file opposing evidence. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe trial judge can avoid the scenario just described by holding her fire, denying the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a), and letting the jury deliberate, even if she views Pavarotti\u2019s case as too weak to support a rational verdict. Usually, things will work out. If the judge thinks that Pavarotti has failed to meet the burden of production, that his proof is so desperately weak that she is tempted to direct a verdict, the jury will likely conclude that he has not met his burden of proof, the more-probable-than-not standard of proof in a civil case, and return a verdict for Sills anyway. That\u2019s a great outcome from the system\u2019s point of view. Pavarotti will have had every opportunity to prove his case, and will have no complaint that the judge interfered with his right to a jury. And, the party that both the judge and jury think should win did win. If the jury does return a verdict for Pavarotti, the judge has another remedy: she can grant judgment for Sills \u2018\u2018notwithstanding the verdict.\u2019\u2019 That is, she may order a judgment entered for Sills even though the jury rendered a verdict for Pavarotti. Essentially, a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (in federal court, judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b)) is a delayed motion for a directed verdict.

Sills then moves for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and the judge grants the motion, on the ground that the evidence was too weak to support a finding that she was the driver who hit Pavarotti.

R. Civ. P. 50(b). Rule 50(b) provides that, if a motion for a judgment as a matter of law is denied, the motion may be renewed no later than twenty-eight days after entry of judgment. This establishes two prerequisites for the motion. First, it must be made within twenty-eight days after judgment is entered on the jury\u2019s verdict for the plaintiff. Second, the party moving for judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) before the case went to the jury. There is an important practical reason for the requirement that a party who seeks judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for a judgment before the case is submitted to the jury. A party seeking judgment as a matter of law before the case goes to the jury must state the grounds for her position that the plaintiff\u2019s case is too weak. In Question 1, for example, Vicaro would state as grounds for the motion the lack of evidence of the relevant standard of medical care, that his treatment fell below that standard of care, or that his treatment caused Powers\u2019s condition. Now (while it\u2019s unlikely with such a glaring omission), it may be that Powers has this evidence and simply neglected to introduce it. If that is true, Vicaro\u2019s motion acts as a wake-up call to Powers\u2019s lawyer. When the defendant points out the gap in her evidence, she will ask the judge to allow her to reopen her case to offer the omitted evidence. Since a trial is a quest for truth rather than a game of skill, the judge should allow her to do so, absent unfair surprise to Vicaro. So, by requiring the challenge to the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s case at a point where the omission can be remedied, Rule 50(b) facilitates the trial of the case on the merits. In the federal courts, there is a second reason for the prior-motion requirement in order to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Supreme Court held, in a dubious decision, that reconsidering the jury\u2019s verdict violates the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial, unless the judge reserved the right to do so on a motion made before the case went to the jury. Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman, 295 U.S. 654 (1935). Consider how the prior-motion rule should apply in the following case.\n\nQuestion:\n7. Second time around.

Supp. 2d 696, 698-699 (D.N.J. 2000).\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nSuppose that the losing party at trial believes that she has grounds both to seek a new trial and to seek judgment as a matter of law? (Remember, under Federal Rule 50(b), a motion for judgment as a matter of law after the verdict is the equivalent of the common law motion for \u2018\u2018judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\u2019\u2019) Suppose, for example, in the plane crash case in Question 3, that Knox loses at trial and believes that Sardinha\u2019s evidence of negligence was so weak that the jury\u2019s verdict is irrational. In federal court, she would presumably move for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) on that ground. And, if she views the evidence as that weak, she must also view the jury\u2019s verdict as \u2018\u2018against the great weight of the evidence,\u2019\u2019 a ground for a new trial. And, just to make things more interesting, assume as well that she believes the judge\u2019s instruction on causation was wrong. What should Knox do? Well, what would you do? You would make both motions, of course. Naturally, you would prefer that the judge granted your motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), because then you would win outright. But if she won\u2019t do that, you\u2019d certainly like to live to fight another day, by getting a new trial. Federal Rule 50(c) deals with such combined motions. It requires the judge to rule on both motions. If she is inclined to grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law, she should do so, but, under Rule 50(c)(1), she should also rule \u2018\u2018conditionally\u2019\u2019 on the motion for a new trial as well. For example, she might rule as follows: The defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law is granted, since the jury\u2019s finding that the accident resulted from the negligence of Knox is not supported by sufficient evidence to support a rational verdict. However, in the alternative, I find that the jury\u2019s verdict is also against the great weight of the evidence, and I therefore conditionally grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. However, I deny the motion for a new trial based on the causation instruction, since the instruction given accurately reflects the law in this jurisdiction. The trial judge, by ruling on all the motions, facilitates full appellate review of the case. If there is an appeal, the appellate court can review all of the trial judge\u2019s rulings in a single, consolidated appeal. So, if the judge does rule on both motions, what happens next, and how do the parties obtain appellate review of the judge\u2019s rulings on these motions? Here\u2019s a question that illustrates how these decisions will be reviewed on appeal. (Reading Rule 50(c) will help with it.)\n\nQuestion:\n7. Interim finality. Parkins sues Orwell Corporation in federal court under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. At trial, Orwell moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) before the case goes to the jury. The motion is denied. The jury finds for Parkins. Orwell then moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) and in the alternative for a new trial on the ground that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the great weight of the evidence. The judge grants Orwell\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, and conditionally grants the motion for a new trial as well, on the ground that the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nParkins may appeal both orders, since a final judgment will enter for Orwell.\n\nAnalysis:\nA takes the cake\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe trial judge can avoid the scenario just described by holding her fire, denying the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a), and letting the jury deliberate, even if she views Pavarotti\u2019s case as too weak to support a rational verdict. Usually, things will work out. If the judge thinks that Pavarotti has failed to meet the burden of production, that his proof is so desperately weak that she is tempted to direct a verdict, the jury will likely conclude that he has not met his burden of proof, the more-probable-than-not standard of proof in a civil case, and return a verdict for Sills anyway. That\u2019s a great outcome from the system\u2019s point of view. Pavarotti will have had every opportunity to prove his case, and will have no complaint that the judge interfered with his right to a jury.

The standard for granting the motion after verdict is the same as the standard used if the motion is made before the case goes to the jury, that the evidence is too weak to support a rational verdict for the plaintiff. The difference is timing, and, of course, the fact that the jury has rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, so the judge, by granting the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, is declaring the jury\u2019s verdict insupportable.

In federal court, she would presumably move for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) on that ground. And, if she views the evidence as that weak, she must also view the jury\u2019s verdict as \u2018\u2018against the great weight of the evidence,\u2019\u2019 a ground for a new trial. And, just to make things more interesting, assume as well that she believes the judge\u2019s instruction on causation was wrong. What should Knox do? Well, what would you do? You would make both motions, of course. Naturally, you would prefer that the judge granted your motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), because then you would win outright. But if she won\u2019t do that, you\u2019d certainly like to live to fight another day, by getting a new trial. Federal Rule 50(c) deals with such combined motions. It requires the judge to rule on both motions.

For example, she might rule as follows: The defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law is granted, since the jury\u2019s finding that the accident resulted from the negligence of Knox is not supported by sufficient evidence to support a rational verdict. However, in the alternative, I find that the jury\u2019s verdict is also against the great weight of the evidence, and I therefore conditionally grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. However, I deny the motion for a new trial based on the causation instruction, since the instruction given accurately reflects the law in this jurisdiction. The trial judge, by ruling on all the motions, facilitates full appellate review of the case. If there is an appeal, the appellate court can review all of the trial judge\u2019s rulings in a single, consolidated appeal.

However, fairness suggests that a party should only be precluded from litigating a claim in a second action if she litigated it in the first action, or was entitled to litigate it there. Claim preclusion would deprive a party of due process of law if it barred a court from considering a claim in a second action that the party could not have presented in the first. Thus, in determining what claims are barred by claim preclusion in a second action, it is important to know what claims could have been\u2014or could not have been\u2014asserted in the first. Today, most procedural systems allow much broader joinder of claims than courts did a hundred years ago. In the federal courts, and in many state court systems as well, a plaintiff may join any claims she has against a defendant, even if they are based on different theories or seek different types of relief. Under earlier procedural rules, plaintiffs were much more constricted in joining claims. They might, for example, under the common law \u2018\u2018forms of action,\u2019\u2019 have been barred from joining claims based on different types of legal theories, such as tort and contract. They might also have had to seek different types of relief, such as money damages or equitable relief (an injunction, rescission of a contract, or an accounting, for example) from different courts.

The State of Emporia does not jump at fancy new concepts, like the unified civil action recognized in Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It remains content with the old common law forms of action. Under Emporia procedure, a plaintiff who brings suit under a writ of assumpsit may assert any contract claims she has against the defendant, even for breach of two unrelated contracts. However, she could not assert claims based on a tort theory under a writ of assumpsit, even if the tort claim arose out of the same underlying facts as the contract claim. Mulligan brings an action in assumpsit against DeLay, seeking damages for breach of contract for the work on the Rolls. Mulligan\u2019s action is dismissed on a motion for summary judgment, on the ground that his contract is unenforceable under the Emporia statute of frauds. A final judgment enters for DeLay. Shortly thereafter, Mulligan brings a new action against DeLay, based on the writ of trespass on the case, alleging that his negligent work on the Rolls rendered it worthless. Under Emporia procedure, an action on the case allows assertion of claims based on negligence. Mulligan\u2019s second action will probably\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nnot be barred, because he could not have asserted it in the first action.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo B is right. Where a party leaves out a claim because it could not be included, claim preclusion will not bar a second action on that claim. Under modern procedure, this will rarely happen.

These \u2018\u2018intersystem preclusion\u2019\u2019 issues can be complex. But a fair working rule is that a court in one system will give the same res judicata effect to a judgment that it would be given in the court that rendered it. See Friedenthal, Kane & Miller, Civil Procedure 682-684 (5th ed. 2015).

Similarly, a federal court, confronted with a second action after a previous action in state court, will apply the claim preclusion rules of the state court that rendered the previous decision.

Pelham alleges that Correro\u2019s conduct in using excessive force in making the arrest violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He loses, because the federal court determines that Correro is entitled to qualified immunity from liability on the federal civil rights claim. Subsequently, Pelham sues Correro in state court for assault and battery, based on the same conduct that gave rise to his federal civil rights action.

They might also have had to seek different types of relief, such as money damages or equitable relief (an injunction, rescission of a contract, or an accounting, for example) from different courts. Here\u2019s a simple example to illustrate the relationship between the scope of joinder under civil procedure rules and the operation of claim preclusion.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Ruin and res judicata. Mulligan hires DeLay to restore his 1933 Rolls Royce, but claims that DeLay ruined it rather than restored it. He sues DeLay in the state courts of Emporia. The State of Emporia does not jump at fancy new concepts, like the unified civil action recognized in Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It remains content with the old common law forms of action. Under Emporia procedure, a plaintiff who brings suit under a writ of assumpsit may assert any contract claims she has against the defendant, even for breach of two unrelated contracts. However, she could not assert claims based on a tort theory under a writ of assumpsit, even if the tort claim arose out of the same underlying facts as the contract claim. Mulligan brings an action in assumpsit against DeLay, seeking damages for breach of contract for the work on the Rolls. Mulligan\u2019s action is dismissed on a motion for summary judgment, on the ground that his contract is unenforceable under the Emporia statute of frauds. A final judgment enters for DeLay. Shortly thereafter, Mulligan brings a new action against DeLay, based on the writ of trespass on the case, alleging that his negligent work on the Rolls rendered it worthless. Under Emporia procedure, an action on the case allows assertion of claims based on negligence. Mulligan\u2019s second action will probably\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nnot be barred, because he could not have asserted it in the first action.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo B is right. Where a party leaves out a claim because it could not be included, claim preclusion will not bar a second action on that claim. Under modern procedure, this will rarely happen. Most American procedural systems allow very broad joinder of claims arising from a single dispute. Since the right to join such claims is broad, the bar on later actions based on that dispute is equally broad.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nA frequent claim preclusion scenario involves a plaintiff who sues in federal court on federal claims, and then brings a later action in state court on related state law claims. This scenario is different from the previous examples, because it involves a court in one system determining what res judicata effect to give to the decision of a court in a different system. These \u2018\u2018intersystem preclusion\u2019\u2019 issues can be complex. But a fair working rule is that a court in one system will give the same res judicata effect to a judgment that it would be given in the court that rendered it. See Friedenthal, Kane & Miller, Civil Procedure 682-684 (5th ed. 2015). Thus, a state court, confronted with a decision of a federal court, will ask, \u2018\u2018could the plaintiff have gone back and tried again in federal court?\u2019\u2019 If she could not have tried again in the rendering court, she will almost always be barred from trying again in another court, in either the state or federal system. Similarly, a federal court, confronted with a second action after a previous action in state court, will apply the claim preclusion rules of the state court that rendered the previous decision. On that premise, consider the following two examples. Keep in mind that the federal courts follow the Second Restatement approach to claim preclusion problems.\n\nQuestion:\n7. Round One. Pelham sues Correro, a police officer who arrested him. He brings suit in federal court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, a federal statute that authorizes suits against persons acting on behalf of the state for violation of federal civil rights. Pelham alleges that Correro\u2019s conduct in using excessive force in making the arrest violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He loses, because the federal court determines that Correro is entitled to qualified immunity from liability on the federal civil rights claim. Subsequently, Pelham sues Correro in state court for assault and battery, based on the same conduct that gave rise to his federal civil rights action. Assume that the state court uses a narrower, \u2018\u2018primary rights\u2019\u2019 approach to claim preclusion, that the assault and battery claims, under that approach, would be viewed as based on different primary rights from the federal civil rights claim and could be brought in a separate action. Pelham\u2019s second action\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nwill not be barred, because he did not assert his state law claims in the initial suit.\n\nAnalysis:\n A is wrong too, because preclusion under the transactional approach does not turn on whether the omitted claim was joined, but on whether it could have been joined. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nNecessary-to-the-judgment hypos make natural closers, because they are so difficult for students to grasp. This requirement seems arbitrary and technical, even silly. But let\u2019s try to understand why courts have consistently included this mysterious limitation on collateral estoppel. Cambria v. Jeffrey, 307 Mass. 49 (1940), provides a classic example of the problem. In slightly simplified form, the facts were as follows: Cambria had an accident with Jeffrey and sued Jeffrey for negligence in causing his injuries. Jeffrey pleaded contributory negligence. At the time of this crusty case, contributory negligence of a plaintiff barred recovery entirely, even if the defendant was negligent too. The case was tried before a judge, not a jury. The judge found that Cambria was negligent, and that Jeffrey was negligent as well. Question: What judgment should the judge enter based on these factual findings? He should dismiss Cambria\u2019s suit. Under the contributory negligence doctrine, a plaintiff who was partially at fault in causing the accident could not recover. The plaintiff had to be blameless to recover, and Cambria was negligent, so he lost. But that wasn\u2019t the end of it. After the judge dismissed Cambria\u2019s suit, Jeffrey sued Cambria for his injuries. (At the time Massachusetts had no compulsory counterclaim rule, so Jeffrey had not waived his claim by failing to assert it in the first action.) Predictably, Cambria pleaded that Jeffrey was contributorily negligent, and asserted that Jeffrey was estopped from denying his negligence, since the judge in the first suit had found that he was. This isn\u2019t a bad argument; the parties litigated Jeffrey\u2019s negligence in Suit One, and the judge decided that he was negligent, so why should Jeffrey be allowed to litigate it again? Despite this logic, the court in Cambria v. Jeffrey held that Jeffrey could litigate it again, because the judge\u2019s finding in the first suit that Jeffrey was negligent was not \u2018\u2018necessary to the judgment.\u2019\u2019 Question: What finding was necessary to the judgment in Suit One? Why did Cambria lose? If you think about it, it\u2019s clear that Cambria did not lose because Jeffrey was negligent . . . that finding would tend to support liability! No, he lost because he (Cambria) was negligent. At the time, a contributorily negligent plaintiff could not win, whether the defendant was negligent or not. Thus, Cambria\u2019s negligence led to the judgment, but the finding that Jeffrey was negligent was irrelevant to the outcome in the first action. Because the judge in the first action never had to decide whether Jeffrey was negligent, that finding was a form of dicta. The finding didn\u2019t affect the outcome, so the judge may not have given it the same serious consideration he would have if it would affect the result. Thus, we can\u2019t have quite the level of confidence in this irrelevant conclusion that we have in a finding that leads to the judgment in the case. There\u2019s another problem with findings that don\u2019t lead to the judgment. They are, usually, unreviewable: Question: Put yourself in Jeffrey\u2019s shoes. The judge has found him negligent. He contemplates a suit against Cambria for his own injuries in the accident. What would he want to do if he feared that he would be estopped from relitigating his negligence in the second action? Naturally, if Jeffrey fears being stuck with the finding that he was negligent, he would want to appeal it and get it reversed, so it would not come back to haunt him in his later suit for his own injuries. Question: If Jeffrey appealed the judge\u2019s finding in the first action that he was negligent, what would the appellate court do? Very likely, the appellate court would say, \u2018\u2018What are you doing here, Jeffrey? You won below. Why should we review the finding that you were negligent? The issue is moot. Even if we agreed with you, it wouldn\u2019t change the outcome, so why should we waste our time reviewing an irrelevant conclusion?\u2019\u2019 And how could they meaningfully review it? If Jeffrey appealed, why would Cambria spend the money to oppose the appeal? He lost anyway, he isn\u2019t likely to litigate an appeal about Jeffrey\u2019s negligence out of pure curiosity. So, Jeffrey would probably not be able to obtain appellate review of the trial judge\u2019s finding that he was negligent. Since the finding did not affect the outcome, and can\u2019t be corrected on appeal, most courts would not give collateral estoppel effect to it. The trick, of course, is to distinguish such miscellaneous findings from those that do affect the outcome, that are \u2018\u2018necessary to the judgment.\u2019\u2019 Consider this case.\n\nQuestion:\n9. Triple play. Perez sues the City of Atlantis, alleging that the mayor violated his First Amendment rights by demoting him from his city job to a lower-paying one because he had supported Appolonia, the losing candidate for mayor in the 2018 election. The City raises three defenses. It denies that Perez was demoted, arguing that he was transferred to an equivalent position. Second, it claims that the mayor never believed that Perez supported Appolonia, so could not have discriminated against him on that basis. Last, it claims that Perez had waived any claim for demotion when he agreed to accept his new position. The case went to trial on all three issues. The jury rendered a general verdict, finding the City liable to Perez for violating his First Amendment rights. A year later, Perez is fired. He sues again, claiming that he was fired in violation of his First Amendment rights, because the mayor believed he had supported Appolonia in the 2018 election.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nPerez may estop the City on the issue of whether the mayor believed that Perez had supported Appolonia. The jury\u2019s verdict indicates that they found that he had believed it, and that finding was necessary to the judgment in the first case.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo we know what they decided on each of these issues. Which of these findings was necessary to the judgment? They all were. The jury had to reject all three defenses in order to render a verdict for Perez. They couldn\u2019t find for Perez without rejecting all three defenses. If, for example, they had found that the mayor had not believed that Perez had supported Appolonia, they would not have awarded damages for violation of his First Amendment rights in demoting him for it. Consequently, their finding on this issue was necessary to the outcome in the first suit. And the same is true of the other two defenses. Thus, C is wrong, because, if the jury had reached a different result on any one of these three defenses, the City would have won. But it didn\u2019t, so the jury must have rejected them all, and rejecting all three led to the verdict they returned. Here, it\u2019s B as in \u2018\u2018Best.\u2019\u2019\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nNecessary-to-the-judgment hypos make natural closers, because they are so difficult for students to grasp.

This requirement is deceiving, however, since a party is frequently precluded from relitigating even though she never litigated anything \u2018\u2018on the merits\u2019\u2019 in the prior action. The point of the \u2018\u2018on the merits\u2019\u2019 requirement is to prevent courts from giving claim preclusive effect to certain procedural dismissals of the first action. For example, if Reynoso sues in federal court, and her case is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, no court would bar her from suing on the same claim in state court. She never had a full opportunity to have her case heard in the first action. Indeed, the court\u2019s reason for dismissal was that it could not hear the claim. As we saw at the outset of the chapter, where a legal theory can\u2019t be asserted in the first action, a second action on that theory will not be barred. So dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and similarly, for lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue, are not viewed as \u2018\u2018on the merits,\u2019\u2019 and do not preclude a second action in another court competent to entertain the claim. In other situations, however, dismissals that clearly do not involve litigation of the claim itself do bar a second action, even though we would not think of them as decisions \u2018\u2018on the merits.\u2019\u2019 (For this reason, the Second Restatement shies away from the phrase entirely.) If a defendant fails to respond to the suit, for example, and judgment is entered by default for the plaintiff, there has clearly been no litigation on the merits. Yet most courts give res judicata effect to a default judgment. That is, they would not allow the defendant, having abandoned his opportunity to defend in Suit One, to try to relitigate the transaction later. The rationale is that the defendant had the opportunity to litigate in Suit One, and is not entitled to ignore the pending action in favor of another action later at a time and place of his own choosing. On the same rationale, a plaintiff who files an action and does not pursue it, leading to a \u2018\u2018dismissal for failure to prosecute,\u2019\u2019 will be barred from bringing a second action. If litigation was commenced, and there was no procedural impediment to prevent the court from hearing it, the parties have had their opportunity to litigate and should either grasp it or recognize that they have waived it. In some cases, the parties may reach the merits but not go to trial. For example, a claim may be resolved on summary judgment, when the court finds that there is no dispute of material fact and one of the parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Or, a case may be dismissed at the outset for \u2018\u2018failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u2019\u2019 In both of these situations, the court has concluded that the plaintiff cannot recover, though neither involves a trial. Virtually all courts would give claim preclusive effect to a summary judgment, and a good many treat the dismissal of a case under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (or similar state court rules) for failure to state a claim as a bar to a new action. When a complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim, the plaintiff will be given the opportunity to replead, to try to state a compensable claim for relief. She may also seek to dismiss the action \u2018\u2018without prejudice,\u2019\u2019 that is, with express recognition by the court that the dismissal of the first action will not bar another suit on the same claim.

His suit is based on breach of warranty (a contract theory) and strict products liability, a tort theory. Rajiv moves to dismiss the contracts claim, on the ground that the Emporia long-arm statute does not authorize jurisdiction over it. The judge concludes that the long-arm statute allows suit against Rajiv for tort claims, but not contract claims, and dismisses the breach of warranty claim. The case goes to trial on the strict liability claim. After Akbar presents his evidence, the trial judge grants a directed verdict for Rajiv, on the ground that Akbar has not presented sufficient evidence that the snowmobile was defective. Judgment is entered for Rajiv. Later, Akbar sues Rajiv again, for the same injuries, again in the Emporia courts. He bases his claim in this action on a negligence theory.

The point of the \u2018\u2018on the merits\u2019\u2019 requirement is to prevent courts from giving claim preclusive effect to certain procedural dismissals of the first action. For example, if Reynoso sues in federal court, and her case is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, no court would bar her from suing on the same claim in state court. She never had a full opportunity to have her case heard in the first action. Indeed, the court\u2019s reason for dismissal was that it could not hear the claim. As we saw at the outset of the chapter, where a legal theory can\u2019t be asserted in the first action, a second action on that theory will not be barred. So dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and similarly, for lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue, are not viewed as \u2018\u2018on the merits,\u2019\u2019 and do not preclude a second action in another court competent to entertain the claim.

If a defendant fails to respond to the suit, for example, and judgment is entered by default for the plaintiff, there has clearly been no litigation on the merits. Yet most courts give res judicata effect to a default judgment. That is, they would not allow the defendant, having abandoned his opportunity to defend in Suit One, to try to relitigate the transaction later. The rationale is that the defendant had the opportunity to litigate in Suit One, and is not entitled to ignore the pending action in favor of another action later at a time and place of his own choosing. On the same rationale, a plaintiff who files an action and does not pursue it, leading to a \u2018\u2018dismissal for failure to prosecute,\u2019\u2019 will be barred from bringing a second action. If litigation was commenced, and there was no procedural impediment to prevent the court from hearing it, the parties have had their opportunity to litigate and should either grasp it or recognize that they have waived it. In some cases, the parties may reach the merits but not go to trial. For example, a claim may be resolved on summary judgment, when the court finds that there is no dispute of material fact and one of the parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Thus, claim preclusion will apply to bar the negligence claim here. A is right.\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe most basic point to understand about supplemental jurisdiction is that it allows federal courts to entertain entire disputes, rather than single theories or claims. Cases seldom come as single claims for relief. Usually, the plaintiff sues on multiple claims, some that support federal jurisdiction under Article III, \u00a72 and others that don\u2019t. For example, if Tolman has a pay dispute with his employer, he might bring suit in federal court against it for violation of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), but also sue, based on the same events, for breach of contract. Maybe he has a claim under a state unfair labor practices statute as well. The federal court would have arising-under jurisdiction over the FLSA claim, but not over the state law contract or statutory claims (assuming the parties are not diverse). But, since all three claims are part of the same dispute, it certainly would be nice if the federal court could hear and resolve them all together. In United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, the Supreme Court held that, if the federal court has a basis for subject matter jurisdiction over one of the plaintiff\u2019s claims, it may hear other claims that arise out of the same \u2018\u2018nucleus of operative fact.\u2019\u2019 In Tolman\u2019s case, the court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331 over the FLSA claim, so it would have constitutional power, under Article III, \u00a72, as interpreted in Gibbs, to hear other claims arising from the same events as well. The Court\u2019s logic was that cases have long involved multiple claims, that the Framers understood this, and that they must have contemplated that the federal court would hear the entire dispute, as long as there was a \u2018\u2018federal hook\u2019\u2019\u2014here, the FLSA claim\u2014from which to append the other, jurisdictionally insufficient claims. So Gibbs recognized a constitutional basis for federal courts to hear related state law claims like Tolman\u2019s contract claim. But in Kroger, the Court reminded the lower federal courts that they can\u2019t hear claims just because they are within the constitutional scope of Article III, as expounded in Gibbs. Congress must authorize them to hear the claims as well, by statute. Even if a state law claim arises from the same underlying facts as a proper federal claim, so that Gibbs provides constitutional power to hear the state law claim, and even if it would make sense for the federal court to resolve all the claims in the case, it cannot do so unless a federal statute authorizes the federal court to hear the related claims. Unfortunately, most federal statutes say nothing one way or the other about the authority to hear related state-law claims. Consequently, Kroger, and especially Finley v. United States, 490 U.S. 545 (1989), nine years later, created considerable confusion as to when a federal court could exercise jurisdiction over such related claims in federal cases. So Congress reacted to those cases by enacting 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a), which broadly authorizes federal courts to exercise \u2018\u2018supplemental jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 over related claims in proper federal cases. Here\u2019s the basic provision granting supplemental jurisdiction: Section 1367(a). Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) or as expressly provided otherwise by Federal statute, in any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution. Such supplemental jurisdiction shall include claims that involve the joinder or intervention of additional parties. What does this mean? It means that where the federal court has \u2018\u2018original jurisdiction,\u2019\u2019 because the case presents a claim that the plaintiff could properly file in federal court, the court can hear not only that claim, but all other claims arising out of the \u2018\u2018same case or controversy.\u2019\u2019 And, the legislative history of \u00a71367, as well as case law, make clear that all claims that meet the Gibbs \u2018\u2018common nucleus of operative fact\u2019\u2019 test are part of the same \u2018\u2018case or controversy.\u2019\u2019 So, as long as the court has a federal \u2018\u2018hook\u2019\u2019\u2014a claim properly within the federal court\u2019s original jurisdiction\u2014it can hang all the related state law claims from it, and resolve the entire dispute between the parties. There\u2019s more to \u00a71367, but for now let\u2019s focus on this basic purpose of \u00a71367(a).\n\nQuestion:\n1. This and that. Garabedian, an Arkansas developer, sues Ellis, a local Arkansas official, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, for deprivation of his First Amendment rights, for refusing to allow him to speak at a local zoning meeting concerning a proposal by a competitor. He adds a second claim against Ellis for defamation, a state tort claim, based on statements Ellis made to the local newspaper about the quality of the construction on several houses Garabedian had built in town. The federal court\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nhas neither constitutional nor statutory authority to hear Garabedian\u2019s defamation claim.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo D is the best choice here.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThis is not the place to go into supplemental jurisdiction in detail\u2014we\u2019ll do that in Chapter 14. But it is useful to introduce the problem of cases that include some claims that satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction, but also others that do not. Very commonly, cases involve not one claim, but several\u2014perhaps two, or perhaps ten. Civil procedure has a nasty doctrine called res judicata, which provides that once you have sued a defendant for claims arising out of a set of events, you can\u2019t do it again. Consequently, lawyers know that whatever claims they have against a defendant arising from a particular dispute must be asserted when they bring suit the first time. Suppose, for example, that Greenstein, a New Yorker, sues Panil, another New Yorker, for infringing her patent, claiming that she had licensed Panil to use the patented device for limited purposes, but Panil had exceeded those limits. This claim arises under the federal patent statutes, so the federal court has arising-under jurisdiction to hear it. However, Greenstein might also allege a claim for breach of contract as well, based on the same acts by Panil. This is a state claim between two parties from the same state. It doesn\u2019t arise under federal law, and there\u2019s no diversity. If it were brought alone, the federal court would not have jurisdiction to hear it. But it wasn\u2019t brought alone; it was brought along with a proper federal claim and arises from the same events. It makes sense that it should be litigated along with the federal claim. But how can it be? Subject matter jurisdiction is fundamental, and what gives the federal court subject matter jurisdiction over Greenstein\u2019s contract claim? The Supreme Court has held that where the plaintiff asserts a claim that properly supports federal court jurisdiction, it is constitutionally permissible for the federal court to hear the entire dispute between the parties, including other claims that arise from the same \u2018\u2018nucleus of operative facts\u2019\u2019 but could not be brought in federal court alone. United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966). And Congress has conveyed such \u2018\u2018supplemental\u2019\u2019 jurisdiction to the federal district courts in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a), which authorizes the federal court, if it has jurisdiction over one claim, to hear other claims that are part of the same \u2018\u2018case or controversy.\u2019\u2019 Basically, a claim is part of the same case or controversy as the main claim (the one that gives the federal court jurisdiction) if it arises from the same set of underlying facts, the \u2018\u2018common nucleus of operative facts\u2019\u2019 test of Gibbs. So the bottom line is (a little oversimplified, but close enough until we get to Chapter 14) that a plaintiff who has asserted one substantial claim that properly invokes federal jurisdiction may have her entire dispute heard in federal court, including state law claims that couldn\u2019t otherwise be brought in federal court. Here\u2019s a basic illustration.\n\nQuestion:\n9. Tagging along. Isaacs, a Montana citizen, sues United Tool and Die Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Montana, under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). He sues in federal court. Isaacs claims that United fired him because of his age, replacing him with a younger employee. Isaacs also asserts a second claim in his complaint, alleging that firing him constituted a breach of his contract of employment. He asserts a third claim in the complaint, alleging that, a year before he was fired, United had misappropriated a design he created for a new grinding wheel. Isaacs claimed he had invented the wheel on his own, not in the course of his employment, so that United had no right to exploit the idea without his consent. The federal court has subject matter jurisdiction\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nover the ADEA claim only.\n\nAnalysis:\nC is also wrong, because, even though there is no independent basis for jurisdiction over Isaacs\u2019s state law claims, there will be supplemental jurisdiction over at least one. The supplemental jurisdiction statute authorizes federal courts that have jurisdiction over a case, because a proper federal claim is asserted, to hear the entire \u2018\u2018case,\u2019\u2019 that is, the parties\u2019 entire dispute arising out of the same underlying facts. That includes claims arising from those events that don\u2019t independently qualify for federal court jurisdiction. Here, Isaacs\u2019s breach of contract claim arises from his discharge, as his federal ADEA claim does. Since the ADEA claim arises under federal law, it provides a basis for federal court jurisdiction, and supplemental jurisdiction sweeps in other claims arising from the same facts. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a) (allowing supplemental claims that arise out of the \u2018\u2018same case or controversy\u2019\u2019 as the federally sufficient claim). \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nLet\u2019s start with the easiest question: if a plaintiff wants to sue a defendant on a claim, can she also assert other claims against the defendant? If so, which claims? The governing rule in federal court is simple: Fed. R. Civ. P. 18(a): Joinder of Claims. A party asserting a claim, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-party claim may join, as independent or alternate claims, as many claims, as it has against an opposing party. This is clear and comprehensive: When Amos sues Boris in federal court for a fraud claim, Boris is an \u2018\u2018opposing party\u2019\u2019; that is, he\u2019s on the other side of the \u2018\u2018v.\u2019\u2019 So Amos can assert \u2018\u2018as many claims . . . as [he] has\u2019\u2019 against Boris. Consider the application of Rule 18(a) in the following example.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Potpourri. Felina, a real estate agent, sues Pai, who owns the real estate agency where she worked. She sues in federal court, for violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. She claims that Pai discharged her from the agency because of her age, and seeks $100,000 in money damages. She also asserts, in the same complaint against Pai, a claim that she and Pai were informal partners in a venture to buy a large piece of open land, and that Pai took title to the land in her own name only, in violation of their contract. She seeks specific performance of the contract, through an order to convey a half interest in the property to her. Last she seeks compensatory and punitive damages from Pai for breach of her fiduciary duty as a partner in the land deal.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nJoinder of the three claims is proper.\n\nAnalysis:\nRule 18(a) says that a party may join \u2018\u2018as many claims as it has\u2019\u2019 against the opposing party. It doesn\u2019t say anything about suing for the same type of relief. It doesn\u2019t say that the plaintiff can only join claims if they arise from the same underlying transaction or occurrence. It says anything may be joined . . . so why shouldn\u2019t you believe it? D is right. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nSo, after Erie the federal court cannot make the law in a diversity case. Instead, it must apply the law of the relevant state. Consider, in light of this, what precedential effect a state trial judge should give to a federal diversity court\u2019s holding on the content of that state\u2019s law.\n\nQuestion:\n6. Deference due? Red & Orange Taxicab Company has a contract with the Tennessee Southern Railway, allowing it exclusive access to the Railway\u2019s grounds to pick up and discharge passengers at the Memphis, Tennessee station. In 1942, after Erie Railroad v. Tompkins was decided, Blue & Green Taxicab Company starts picking up passengers at the station, arguing that Red & Orange\u2019s contract is unenforceable because such exclusive contracts are against public policy. Red & Orange brings a diversity action in federal court, seeking to enjoin Blue & Green from using the station grounds. The federal judge, under Erie, is bound to apply Tennessee law, but assume that Tennessee has never decided the issue. The federal district judge concludes, after reviewing Tennessee cases in related areas, that Tennessee would hold such exclusive contracts enforceable.

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71446(b)(1), the notice of removal must be filed within thirty days \u2018\u2018after receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief. . . .\u2019\u2019 There\u2019s a reason for this short window to remove a case. The state court needs to know whether it is going to hear the case or not. Under \u00a71446(b)(1), the case will either be bumped into federal court within thirty days, or the state court will know that the case won\u2019t be removed, that it has jurisdiction, and can get down to business. But there is an exception. Sometimes a case filed in state court is not removable, but becomes removable later. For example, McCoy, a Mississippi plaintiff, might sue Caswell, a Mississippi defendant, on a state law claim. The case can\u2019t be removed, since there is neither diversity nor a claim under federal law. But later McCoy might amend the complaint to assert a federal claim. Amendments are generally freely allowed, at least in the early stages of the litigation, so this is a realistic possibility. Once the amendment is allowed, the case contains a claim arising under federal law. If it had been filed in this form initially, it would have been removable. Can the defendant remove after the amendment? Another example: McCoy, a Mississippi plaintiff, sues Gupta, a Texas defendant, on a state law claim, for $200,000, and sues Caswell, a Mississippi defendant, as a co-defendant in the action. This case is not removable, since there is no complete diversity. But suppose that later McCoy dismisses her claim against Caswell? Now the case has become a diversity case. Can the defendant remove? In such cases, the statute allows removal once the case becomes removable. Section 1446(b)(3) provides that, if the action wasn\u2019t removable as originally filed, it can be removed within thirty days after the defendant receives notice of an amended pleading or order that makes the action removable. This is an important provision, which reduces the incentive for the plaintiff to play games with the jurisdictional rules. Without this provision in \u00a71446(b), the plaintiff could file the case in a nonremovable form, let the thirty-day period for removal run, and then amend her complaint to assert a claim under federal law. The defendant would be stuck in state court in a case in which the plaintiff intended all along to seek recovery under federal law. But under \u00a71446(b)(3), this ploy won\u2019t work; once the amendment is allowed, adding a claim arising under federal law, and the defendant receives notice of that amendment, she will have thirty days to remove the now-removable action to federal court.

Eagleton, a Utah citizen, answers the complaint, denying that she owes anything on the account.

The parties started to litigate in state court, and then the plaintiff added a federal claim. After the amendment, Eagleton removes the case, based on the newly added claim arising under federal law. However, \u00a71446(b)(3), read carefully, bars removal. It authorizes removal later in the case if it was not removable as originally filed, but becomes removable due to an amendment or for other reasons. That isn\u2019t this case: Eagleton\u2019s case was a proper diversity case and was therefore removable when filed. She chose not to remove within thirty days of receiving notice of the original complaint. Now she wants a second bite at the apple, since Diversified has asserted a federal claimand she would rather litigate the federal claim in federal court. Unfortunately for Eagleton, \u00a71446(b)(3) doesn\u2019t authorize removal. Both C and D are wrong, because, if the case was removable originally, and the defendant failed to remove it within thirty days, she has lost the option of federal court. Doubtless, Congress could authorize removal in these circumstances. It could rewrite \u00a7 1446(b)(3) to allow a second shot when a new basis of federal jurisdiction is asserted. This might even make good policy: a defendant might be perfectly willing to litigate a contract case in the state court, but prefer federal court to litigate the federal claim that is added later.

Here\u2019s an interesting question on the application of \u00a71446(b)(3).\n\nQuestion:\n3. Professor\u2019s delight. Diversified Investments, Inc., an investment corporation, sues Eagleton for breach of contract, to collect $300,000 due on a margin account she had with Diversified. Diversified is incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Colorado. It has a large office in Salt Lake City, Utah. Diversified brings the action in Colorado. Eagleton, a Utah citizen, answers the complaint, denying that she owes anything on the account. Four months later, Diversified moves to amend its complaint to add a claim against Eagleton under a federal fraud statute, based on misrepresentations Eagleton allegedly made in establishing her margin account. The motion is granted. Two weeks later, Eagleton removes the action to federal court. Diversified moves to remand the case to state court. The motion to remand should be\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ngranted, because Eagleton did not remove the action within thirty days after the action was filed.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo, the answer is B. The action should be remanded because it was not removed within thirty days of the original filing. This question is a \u2018\u2018professor\u2019s delight,\u2019\u2019 because, while it is fair, it is tricky. The question focuses the student on the amendment adding the federal claim, and invites her to overlook the crucial fact that Eagleton could have removed earlier and did not. Remember the comment that the multistate bar exam (which is all multiple choice) is \u2018\u2018an exercise in reading comprehension.\u2019\u2019 Here\u2019s a good example of that. You might know the law, or be capable of solving this problem by careful reading of \u00a71446(b)(3) (remember, I\u2019m assuming that you have the statutes in front of you in answering these questions), but miss the point by a mile if you don\u2019t analyze the question carefully. Probably students get more questions wrong from such analytical slips than they do from a lack of substantive knowledge.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe removal statute sets a strict limit on the time for removing a case to federal court. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71446(b)(1), the notice of removal must be filed within thirty days \u2018\u2018after receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief. . . .\u2019\u2019 There\u2019s a reason for this short window to remove a case. The state court needs to know whether it is going to hear the case or not. Under \u00a71446(b)(1), the case will either be bumped into federal court within thirty days, or the state court will know that the case won\u2019t be removed, that it has jurisdiction, and can get down to business. But there is an exception. Sometimes a case filed in state court is not removable, but becomes removable later. For example, McCoy, a Mississippi plaintiff, might sue Caswell, a Mississippi defendant, on a state law claim. The case can\u2019t be removed, since there is neither diversity nor a claim under federal law. But later McCoy might amend the complaint to assert a federal claim. Amendments are generally freely allowed, at least in the early stages of the litigation, so this is a realistic possibility. Once the amendment is allowed, the case contains a claim arising under federal law. If it had been filed in this form initially, it would have been removable. Can the defendant remove after the amendment? Another example: McCoy, a Mississippi plaintiff, sues Gupta, a Texas defendant, on a state law claim, for $200,000, and sues Caswell, a Mississippi defendant, as a co-defendant in the action. This case is not removable, since there is no complete diversity. But suppose that later McCoy dismisses her claim against Caswell? Now the case has become a diversity case. Can the defendant remove? In such cases, the statute allows removal once the case becomes removable. Section 1446(b)(3) provides that, if the action wasn\u2019t removable as originally filed, it can be removed within thirty days after the defendant receives notice of an amended pleading or order that makes the action removable. This is an important provision, which reduces the incentive for the plaintiff to play games with the jurisdictional rules. Without this provision in \u00a71446(b), the plaintiff could file the case in a nonremovable form, let the thirty-day period for removal run, and then amend her complaint to assert a claim under federal law. The defendant would be stuck in state court in a case in which the plaintiff intended all along to seek recovery under federal law. But under \u00a71446(b)(3), this ploy won\u2019t work; once the amendment is allowed, adding a claim arising under federal law, and the defendant receives notice of that amendment, she will have thirty days to remove the now-removable action to federal court.

In fact, it continues to give rise to a great deal of fact-specific litigation, applying Shoe\u2019s general principles to the myriad facts of human experience. But the real kicker for my students has been the stream-of-commerce problem addressed\u2014or obfuscated\u2014in Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court, 480 U.S. 102 (1987) and revisited by the Court in J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro, 131 S. Ct. 2780 (2011). This section probes the meaning of so-called stream-of-commerce jurisdiction. \u2018\u2018Stream of commerce\u2019\u2019 is a phrase that refers to the entry of a defendant\u2019s products into the forum state through commercial channels of distribution. For example, suppose that Snoflake Incorporated makes snowblowers in Nevada and sells them to a wholesaler in Oregon, which resells them to retail stores in ten states, including Wyoming. If Wakimoto buys a Snoflake snowblower at a hardware store in Wyoming and is injured using it in Wyoming, will a Wyoming court have personal jurisdiction over Snowflake for his claim? Snoflake did not sell the snowblower in Wyoming itself. It may or may not have known that the wholesaler would resell its product there. But it did sell its product into the stream of commerce with the hope that it would be sold widely, and with knowledge that, if it was defective, it could injure a user wherever it was bought and used. And, of course, it cheerfully accepted the profits derived, ultimately, from sales in Wyoming. The stream-of-commerce question is whether Snoflake\u2019s sale of the product to the wholesaler in Oregon, with the hope and expectation that it would be resold to consumers in other states, establishes a sufficient contact with the final purchaser\u2019s state to support personal jurisdiction where Wakimoto buys and uses it and is injured by it. This is an important question, to which the Supreme Court has given only an equivocal answer. In World-Wide Volkswagen v. Woodson, the Court appeared to suggest that selling into the stream of commerce in one state, which leads to resale to consumers in a different state, would support jurisdiction there if the consumer was injured where she bought it (not where she took it, as World-Wide holds). See World-Wide, 444 U.S. at 297 (jurisdiction appropriate where injury results from manufacturer or distributor\u2019s efforts to \u2018\u2018serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in other states\u2019\u2019). But the Court later divided on this issue in Asahi. In Asahi, the defendant made a component that was incorporated into a final product in another country and resold into California. The question was whether the component maker had sufficient contacts with California to support jurisdiction, when a consumer bought the product there and was injured by it there. Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s opinion suggested that a defendant that merely sold its product to another company, without controlling where that other company would redistribute it as part of its final product, was not subject to jurisdiction where the finished product was ultimately sold. Jurisdiction, Justice O\u2019Connor suggested, is based on purposeful availment, and the mere sale of a part\u2014or 100,000 parts\u2014from Japan to Taiwan did not establish minimum contacts with California. Instead, she would require that a defendant like Asahi actually establish direct contacts in the consumer\u2019s state to subject it to suit there for injuries caused by its products sold in the state. She would find such \u2018\u2018purposeful availment\u2019\u2019 if the defendant establishes sales agents in the state, advertises there, has dealership networks there, or makes other deliberate efforts, itself, to market its goods in the state of ultimate sale to the consumer. Justice Brennan\u2019s concurring opinion in Asahi, however, appeared to accept the principle that sales of large quantities of the defendant\u2019s product in an American state, even indirectly through the stream of commerce, would support jurisdiction in that state, if the plaintiff suffered injury there from the product. Justice Stevens, while finding it unnecessary to reach the minimum contacts question, also appeared inclined to find jurisdiction based on indirect sales in a state, depending on the nature and quantity of those sales. However, while the Justices could not agree on what constitutes \u2018\u2018purposeful availment\u2019\u2019 in a stream- of-commerce case, eight did agree that, even if minimum contacts existed, it would be unreasonable on the facts of the case for the California court to exercise jurisdiction over Asahi, since the dispute remaining after the plaintiff settled was a claim for indemnification between two Asian corporations. We Civil Procedure wonks waited long and anxiously\u2014for twenty- four years\u2014for the Court to clarify this vexing problem. Finally the Court took certiorari in J. McIntyre Machinery Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873 (2011), and we looked forward to further wisdom on stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Alas, fooled again. The case involved a machine made in England, imported to a distributor in Ohio, and resold into New Jersey. Nicastro was injured there using the machine and brought suit against the English manufacturer in New Jersey. It argued, predictably, that it was not subject to personal jurisdiction for this claim in New Jersey, since it had done nothing in New Jersey at all; it had just made machines in England and sold them to a distributor in Ohio. In Nicastro the Court again split badly on the reach of stream-of- commerce jurisdiction. Justice Kennedy\u2019s plurality opinion, joined by three other justices, concluded that J. McIntyre had not \u2018\u2018engaged in conduct purposely directed to New Jersey\u2019\u2019 (564 U.S. at 886) and therefore could not be sued in New Jersey for Nicastro\u2019s claim. Two justices filed a concurring opinion saying, essentially, \u2018\u2018no jurisdiction on these facts but we might rule differently if there were a regular course of sales into New Jersey, or deliberate efforts to cultivate the New Jersey market.\u2019\u2019 And three dissenters argued, vociferously, that J. McIntyre had sought to cultivate the United States market, had succeeded in doing so, and ought to defend the product in a state where it was resold to the ultimate user and caused injury. So, neither Asahi nor McIntyre provides clear guidance on the stream-of-commerce problem. There will be a lot of unclear cases, and expensive litigation of the jurisdiction issue in such cases will continue. Perhaps this is inevitable; perhaps the Justices have not given us a clear answer because there never can be one for a problem with so many possible variations. But the following questions may help you to at least define the parameters of the problem.\n\nQuestion:\n8. A distinction with a difference? Atlanta Precision Drill Corporation makes drill presses in Georgia. It sells them to several wholesale distributors, including Emporia Distributors in Pennsylvania. It sells five hundred drill presses to Emporia and agrees to give them a price rebate on any presses resold into Maryland, a state in which it has no distributor. Emporia resells five presses to Modern Tool and Die Co. in Annapolis, Maryland. A local machine shop buys one from Modern, and Edwards, an employee, is injured using it in Maryland. He sues Atlanta Precision in state court in Maryland for his injuries. Atlanta Precision has no other contacts in Maryland. After the J. McIntyre decision the Maryland court will probably conclude that it\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nhas jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision, because it has purposely engaged in conduct calculated to serve the market for its products in Maryland.\n\nAnalysis:\nIn this example Atlanta Precision has focused on Maryland sales and has taken action to promote them. It has not cast its products into the stream to flow wherever they will; it has encouraged their resale in Maryland by its price break to Emporia. I think this would meet Justice O\u2019Connor\u2019s requirement that the defendant deliberately focus on promoting sales of its product in the forum state.

Two justices filed a concurring opinion saying, essentially, \u2018\u2018no jurisdiction on these facts but we might rule differently if there were a regular course of sales into New Jersey, or deliberate efforts to cultivate the New Jersey market.\u2019\u2019 And three dissenters argued, vociferously, that J. McIntyre had sought to cultivate the United States market, had succeeded in doing so, and ought to defend the product in a state where it was resold to the ultimate user and caused injury. So, neither Asahi nor McIntyre provides clear guidance on the stream-of-commerce problem. There will be a lot of unclear cases, and expensive litigation of the jurisdiction issue in such cases will continue. Perhaps this is inevitable; perhaps the Justices have not given us a clear answer because there never can be one for a problem with so many possible variations. But the following questions may help you to at least define the parameters of the problem.\n\nQuestion:\n9. Between two extremes. Atlanta Precision Drill Corporation makes drill presses in Georgia. It sells them to several wholesale distributors, including Emporia Distributors in Pennsylvania. It sells about five hundred drill presses a year to Emporia. Emporia resells in ten states, including Maryland, where it typically resells about one hundred presses a year. It sells one of them to Modern Tool and Die Co. in Annapolis, Maryland. A local machine shop buys one from Modern, and Edwards, an employee, is injured using it in Annapolis. He sues Atlanta Precision in state court in Maryland for his injuries. Atlanta Precision has no other contacts in Maryland. After the J. McIntyre decision the Maryland court will probably conclude that it\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ndefinitely lacks personal jurisdiction over Atlanta Precision, because it did not sell into Maryland or encourage Emporia to do so.\n\nAnalysis:\nA might be right, but it probably reads Justice Breyer\u2019s concurring opinion in J. McIntyre too narrowly. That opinion rejected jurisdiction on the facts of the case but suggested that in other circumstances a regular flow of goods into the state would support jurisdiction. Here, a significant number of Atlanta Precision presses are sold in Maryland each year, which would likely influence Justice Breyer to find jurisdiction proper. At the least, we can\u2019t say that he (and Justice Alito, the other concurring Justice) would \u2018\u2018definitely\u2019\u2019 find no jurisdiction where the manufacturer\u2019s goods are being resold in significant quantities in the state on a regular basis. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nRule 12 lays several traps for the unwary defendant.

As Pennoyer v. Neff explains, for many years courts proceeded on the premise that their authority to exercise jurisdiction was based on physical power. A court could exercise jurisdiction over a person within the territory of the state (\u2018\u2018in personam jurisdiction\u2019\u2019) if he was symbolically arrested there through service of process. Or the court could exercise jurisdiction over property within the state (\u2018\u2018in rem jurisdiction\u2019\u2019) if the property was seized through attachment. The process for seizure of property through attachment varied from state to state, and for different types of property. Usually, land was (and still is) attached by obtaining a writ of attachment from the court and filing it in the registry of deeds or other office for recording titles, and perhaps posting notice of the attachment on the property as well. This gives notice to the world that the court has assumed jurisdiction over the property and might enter an order affecting its title. For tangible personal assets, the property may be taken into custody by the sheriff pursuant to a writ of attachment issued by the court, or a keeper appointed to retain control of the property pending further order from the court. Attachment provided an alternative means to satisfy claims of local citizens when the defendant could not be sued there in personam. Suppose, for example, that Neff hired Mitchell, an Oregon lawyer, to represent him in a divorce case in Oregon, but moved to California without paying Mitchell\u2019s fee. Under the jurisdictional principles of Pennoyer v. Neff, Neff could not be sued in personam in Oregon, since he could not be served with process there. However, if he had left property in the state, the court could assert jurisdiction over that property by attaching it. It could then adjudicate Mitchell\u2019s fees claim, and if it concluded that Neff owed the fee (or if Neff defaulted), it could order Neff\u2019s property sold to satisfy Mitchell\u2019s claim. Thus, in rem jurisdiction provided an alternative means of satisfying a claim, if the defendant had obligingly left property subject to attachment in the forum state. Often, however, the in rem alternative would not be fully satisfactory. Because the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate was based on its seizure of property, not power over the defendant personally, it could only dispose of the property before it. If the court determined that Mitchell was owed $300, but Neff\u2019s attached property sold for $200, the court could not enter an order requiring Neff to pay the other $100. To do so would be to exercise jurisdiction over Neff personally, but Neff wasn\u2019t before the court; only the property was. So, the in rem remedy was limited to the value of the property the court had attached at the outset of the case.1 Even if the property was worth less than the plaintiff\u2019s claim, however, an in rem action placed the defendant in a difficult position. Consider the following example.\n\nQuestion:\n4. Hostage-taking. In the era before International Shoe and Shaffer v. Heitner, Mitchell sues Neff in Oregon for a $20,000 legal fee. Neff claims that he had already paid the fee, but Mitchell claims that his payment was for other services. Neff lives in California and cannot be served with process in Oregon. However, he had left his Model T in the garage at his brother\u2019s house in Bend, Oregon. Mitchell obtains a writ of attachment and has the Model T, worth $6,000, seized by the sheriff. Neff receives notice of the suit and the attachment, and consults you for advice on how to respond to the suit and the attachment. Which advice would be most appropriate?\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nNeff should appear and defend the underlying claim, to avoid losing his Model T.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo D seems like the only sensible course. If Neff has a viable defense to the underlying fees claim, and he doesn\u2019t want to lose the Model T, he will have to appear and defend the action. This illustrates the potential power of an in rem action under traditional practice: Property left in the state could serve as a hostage to force the defendant back into the forum. Suppose that Neff did return to defend the Oregon action, to avoid losing his Ford. Would he, by doing so, submit to full personal jurisdiction? Not necessarily. A good many states allowed a defendant in Neff\u2019s position to enter a \u2018\u2018limited appearance\u2019\u2019 to protect his property from sale. He could appear and defend the fees claim on the merits without submitting to personal jurisdiction. Consequently, if he lost on the fees claim, the court could order sale of the attached assets, but it could not enter a personal judgment against Neff for any remaining balance. See R. Freer, Civil Procedure 291 (3d ed. 2012). If local state law authorized such a limited appearance, his exposure was limited to the value of the attached property.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nUnlike jurisdiction \u2018\u2018in personam,\u2019\u2019 that is, over the person of the defendant, \u2018\u2018in rem\u2019\u2019 jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction over a thing, an item of property.

The process for seizure of property through attachment varied from state to state, and for different types of property. Usually, land was (and still is) attached by obtaining a writ of attachment from the court and filing it in the registry of deeds or other office for recording titles, and perhaps posting notice of the attachment on the property as well. This gives notice to the world that the court has assumed jurisdiction over the property and might enter an order affecting its title. For tangible personal assets, the property may be taken into custody by the sheriff pursuant to a writ of attachment issued by the court, or a keeper appointed to retain control of the property pending further order from the court. Attachment provided an alternative means to satisfy claims of local citizens when the defendant could not be sued there in personam. Suppose, for example, that Neff hired Mitchell, an Oregon lawyer, to represent him in a divorce case in Oregon, but moved to California without paying Mitchell\u2019s fee. Under the jurisdictional principles of Pennoyer v. Neff, Neff could not be sued in personam in Oregon, since he could not be served with process there. However, if he had left property in the state, the court could assert jurisdiction over that property by attaching it. It could then adjudicate Mitchell\u2019s fees claim, and if it concluded that Neff owed the fee (or if Neff defaulted), it could order Neff\u2019s property sold to satisfy Mitchell\u2019s claim. Thus, in rem jurisdiction provided an alternative means of satisfying a claim, if the defendant had obligingly left property subject to attachment in the forum state. Often, however, the in rem alternative would not be fully satisfactory. Because the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate was based on its seizure of property, not power over the defendant personally, it could only dispose of the property before it. If the court determined that Mitchell was owed $300, but Neff\u2019s attached property sold for $200, the court could not enter an order requiring Neff to pay the other $100. To do so would be to exercise jurisdiction over Neff personally, but Neff wasn\u2019t before the court; only the property was. So, the in rem remedy was limited to the value of the property the court had attached at the outset of the case.1 Even if the property was worth less than the plaintiff\u2019s claim, however, an in rem action placed the defendant in a difficult position. Consider the following example.\n\nQuestion:\n4. Hostage-taking. In the era before International Shoe and Shaffer v. Heitner, Mitchell sues Neff in Oregon for a $20,000 legal fee. Neff claims that he had already paid the fee, but Mitchell claims that his payment was for other services. Neff lives in California and cannot be served with process in Oregon. However, he had left his Model T in the garage at his brother\u2019s house in Bend, Oregon. Mitchell obtains a writ of attachment and has the Model T, worth $6,000, seized by the sheriff. Neff receives notice of the suit and the attachment, and consults you for advice on how to respond to the suit and the attachment. Which advice would be most appropriate?\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nNeff should appear and defend the underlying claim, to avoid losing his Model T.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo D seems like the only sensible course. If Neff has a viable defense to the underlying fees claim, and he doesn\u2019t want to lose the Model T, he will have to appear and defend the action. This illustrates the potential power of an in rem action under traditional practice: Property left in the state could serve as a hostage to force the defendant back into the forum. Suppose that Neff did return to defend the Oregon action, to avoid losing his Ford. Would he, by doing so, submit to full personal jurisdiction? Not necessarily. A good many states allowed a defendant in Neff\u2019s position to enter a \u2018\u2018limited appearance\u2019\u2019 to protect his property from sale. He could appear and defend the fees claim on the merits without submitting to personal jurisdiction. Consequently, if he lost on the fees claim, the court could order sale of the attached assets, but it could not enter a personal judgment against Neff for any remaining balance. See R. Freer, Civil Procedure 291 (3d ed. 2012). If local state law authorized such a limited appearance, his exposure was limited to the value of the attached property.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nUnlike jurisdiction \u2018\u2018in personam,\u2019\u2019 that is, over the person of the defendant, \u2018\u2018in rem\u2019\u2019 jurisdiction refers to jurisdiction over a thing, an item of property. As Pennoyer v. Neff explains, for many years courts proceeded on the premise that their authority to exercise jurisdiction was based on physical power. A court could exercise jurisdiction over a person within the territory of the state (\u2018\u2018in personam jurisdiction\u2019\u2019) if he was symbolically arrested there through service of process. Or the court could exercise jurisdiction over property within the state (\u2018\u2018in rem jurisdiction\u2019\u2019) if the property was seized through attachment.

Which advice would be most appropriate?\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nNeff should ignore the action, since he is not subject to personal jurisdiction in Oregon.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet\u2019s work through the consequences to Neff of making each choice. If he chooses A, and ignores the action, the Oregon court will enter a default judgment for Mitchell, and order his Model T sold. Mitchell will get the proceeds of the sale. It probably won\u2019t be a full $6,000, because buying at a sheriff\u2019s sale always carries some risk that the procedure may not have been proper, which could give rise to a claim by the prior owner\u2014that\u2019s what gave rise to Pennoyer\u2019s troubles. But Neff will be out one Model T. If, as the question indicates, he has a viable defense to the underlying fees claim, he would be ill-advised to take that course. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nMost of the personal jurisdiction cases you read in civil procedure concern the constitutional limits on a state court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant. But federal courts exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants too. Thus, it\u2019s important to understand the limits on their power to force defendants to defend in a particular district as well. The constitutional limits on a state court\u2019s power to exercise jurisdiction are rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which provides, \u2018\u2018nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law\u2019\u2019 (emphasis supplied). The Fourteenth Amendment applies to the states; it does not apply to the federal government. The Fifth Amendment contains a similar due process clause that does apply to the federal government and its courts. However, it has been interpreted somewhat differently from the Fourteenth. Generally, the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause has been held to allow a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant if she has an appropriate relation to the United States as a whole, not to a particular state. See, e.g., Busch v. Buchman, Buchman & O\u2019Brien Law Firm, 11 F.3d 1255, 1258 (5th Cir. 1994); see generally Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a71068.1. Thus, a defendant with a contact anywhere in the country can probably be required to defend an action arising from that contact in any federal court (just as a defendant with appropriate contacts anywhere in California is subject to jurisdiction in a California court in any part of the state, under the Fourteenth Amendment). Under this analysis, if McGee bought insurance in North Carolina, he could sue the insurer on the policy in a Utah federal court, and it would be constitutional under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause for the Utah federal court to entertain the case, since it arises out of contacts in the United States.7 Even if contacts anywhere in the country will support \u2018\u2018nationwide jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 over a defendant, federal courts seldom exercise such broad jurisdiction. In the federal courts, as in the state courts, jurisdiction must not only be within constitutional limits, but must also be authorized by statute, or, in this case, by court rule.8 In most cases, the reach of personal jurisdiction in the federal courts is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A): \u2018\u2018Service of a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant: (A) who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located. . . .\u2019\u2019 Under this provision, the federal court sitting in Utah is authorized to exercise personal jurisdiction if the courts of Utah could do so. A federal court sitting in Texas could exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant if the courts of Texas could, and so on. Clearly, this rule restricts federal jurisdiction in many cases in which the Fifth Amendment would allow much wider jurisdiction. The rule has the great virtue, however, of making the reach of personal jurisdiction the same (in most cases) in the federal and state courts sitting in the same state. This neutralizes personal jurisdiction as a forum shopping factor: Under Rule 4(k)(1)(A), the plaintiff won\u2019t be able to obtain jurisdiction over a defendant in federal court unless she could in the local state courts. There are some situations in which federal courts do exercise broader jurisdiction than the state courts. Congress may authorize nationwide jurisdiction in particular types of cases. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. \u00a71361 (authorizing nationwide service of process in interpleader cases). But such statutes are the exception.

Jason then moves to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe federal court should deny the motion if the courts of Arizona would have personal jurisdiction over Jason under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Arizona long-arm statute.\n\nAnalysis:\nHere, the statute (Rule, actually) says that the federal court can exercise jurisdiction over Jason if the state court could.

The federal judge has to ask herself, \u2018\u2018If I were sitting in the Arizona state court, could I force Jason to come in and defend this action here?\u2019\u2019 The answer to that depends on whether an Arizona statute authorizes jurisdiction over Jason and whether it would be consistent with due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to exercise it.

In most cases, including most cases based on federal law, Rule 4(k)(l)(A) provides the applicable \u2018\u2018long-arm statute\u2019\u2019 for the federal courts. Here\u2019s a question to illustrate the point.\n\nQuestion:\n6. Dueling amendments. Argo, from Arizona, sues Jason, from New Mexico, in an Arizona state court on a breach-of-contract claim, arising from Jason\u2019s alleged failure to complete a landscaping job in New Mexico. Jason removes the action to federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Jason then moves to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe federal court should deny the motion if the courts of Arizona would have personal jurisdiction over Jason under the Fourteenth Amendment and the Arizona long-arm statute.\n\nAnalysis:\nHere, the statute (Rule, actually) says that the federal court can exercise jurisdiction over Jason if the state court could. What determines if the state court could? The Arizona long-arm statute and the Fourteenth Amendment (not the Fifth). The federal judge has to ask herself, \u2018\u2018If I were sitting in the Arizona state court, could I force Jason to come in and defend this action here?\u2019\u2019 The answer to that depends on whether an Arizona statute authorizes jurisdiction over Jason and whether it would be consistent with due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to exercise it. Those are the two constraints on the exercise of jurisdiction by an Arizona court. Rule 4(k)(1)(A) makes those same two constraints applicable in an Arizona federal court. B is not right.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nMost of the personal jurisdiction cases you read in civil procedure concern the constitutional limits on a state court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant. But federal courts exercise personal jurisdiction over defendants too. Thus, it\u2019s important to understand the limits on their power to force defendants to defend in a particular district as well. The constitutional limits on a state court\u2019s power to exercise jurisdiction are rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which provides, \u2018\u2018nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law\u2019\u2019 (emphasis supplied). The Fourteenth Amendment applies to the states; it does not apply to the federal government. The Fifth Amendment contains a similar due process clause that does apply to the federal government and its courts. However, it has been interpreted somewhat differently from the Fourteenth. Generally, the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause has been held to allow a federal court to exercise jurisdiction over a defendant if she has an appropriate relation to the United States as a whole, not to a particular state. See, e.g., Busch v. Buchman, Buchman & O\u2019Brien Law Firm, 11 F.3d 1255, 1258 (5th Cir. 1994); see generally Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a71068.1. Thus, a defendant with a contact anywhere in the country can probably be required to defend an action arising from that contact in any federal court (just as a defendant with appropriate contacts anywhere in California is subject to jurisdiction in a California court in any part of the state, under the Fourteenth Amendment). Under this analysis, if McGee bought insurance in North Carolina, he could sue the insurer on the policy in a Utah federal court, and it would be constitutional under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause for the Utah federal court to entertain the case, since it arises out of contacts in the United States.7 Even if contacts anywhere in the country will support \u2018\u2018nationwide jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 over a defendant, federal courts seldom exercise such broad jurisdiction. In the federal courts, as in the state courts, jurisdiction must not only be within constitutional limits, but must also be authorized by statute, or, in this case, by court rule.8 In most cases, the reach of personal jurisdiction in the federal courts is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A): \u2018\u2018Service of a summons or filing a waiver of service establishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant: (A) who is subject to the jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction in the state where the district court is located. . . .\u2019\u2019 Under this provision, the federal court sitting in Utah is authorized to exercise personal jurisdiction if the courts of Utah could do so. A federal court sitting in Texas could exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant if the courts of Texas could, and so on. Clearly, this rule restricts federal jurisdiction in many cases in which the Fifth Amendment would allow much wider jurisdiction. The rule has the great virtue, however, of making the reach of personal jurisdiction the same (in most cases) in the federal and state courts sitting in the same state. This neutralizes personal jurisdiction as a forum shopping factor: Under Rule 4(k)(1)(A), the plaintiff won\u2019t be able to obtain jurisdiction over a defendant in federal court unless she could in the local state courts. There are some situations in which federal courts do exercise broader jurisdiction than the state courts. Congress may authorize nationwide jurisdiction in particular types of cases. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. \u00a71361 (authorizing nationwide service of process in interpleader cases). But such statutes are the exception. In most cases, including most cases based on federal law, Rule 4(k)(l)(A) provides the applicable \u2018\u2018long-arm statute\u2019\u2019 for the federal courts.

Jason then moves to dismiss the action for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe federal court should deny the motion if the Arizona long-arm statute authorizes jurisdiction, and it would be constitutional under the Fifth Amendment for the federal court to require Jason to defend the suit in Arizona.\n\nAnalysis:\nA is right.\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nWe\u2019ve dealt with the pre-answer motion and with putting Rule 12(b) objections in the answer.

Vrabel moves to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. The motion is denied. Vrabel then answers, denying that he was negligent in his representations concerning the transaction. Three months later, after researching the tort of negligent misrepresentation, Vrabel\u2019s lawyer realizes that the tort requires reliance: A defendant is only liable if the plaintiff relied on the misrepresentation in entering into the transaction. Knauss\u2019s complaint does not allege reliance. Vrabel files a motion seeking dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nVrabel has not waived this objection.

Edstrom and Ling perform surgery on Arshad. Things don\u2019t go well, and Arshad sues them for medical malpractice in federal court. After the suit is filed Ling asserts a claim in the action against Edstrom for contribution, that is, claiming that if they are both found negligent and Ling pays, Edstrom should reimburse him for part of the judgment. He also asserts a claim against Edstrom for a share of the profits in their professional corporation, which Edstrom had withheld. In the same pleading, he asserts a claim against Schuman (another surgeon involved in the surgery), claiming that Schuman was also negligent, and should contribute to paying the judgment. Edstrom asserts a claim against Arshad for medical bills Arshad owed him for a previous operation. Assume that there are no subject matter jurisdiction problems with joining these claims.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nEdstrom\u2019s claim against Arshad is properly joined under Rule 18(a), because, once Edstrom is in the action, Rule 18(a) allows him to assert whatever claims he has, related or unrelated to the main claim.\n\nAnalysis:\nA, though tempting, misconstrues Rule 18(a). That rule doesn\u2019t say any party can assert any claim against any other party. If it did, why would we need any of the other joinder rules? No, Rule 18(a) says (though not so clearly) that, once a claimant has properly asserted a claim against another party, she may add on any other claims she has against that party. If Amos asserts a proper claim against Boris under one of the other joinder rules, Rule 18(a) kicks in, authorizing Amos to add on any other claims she has against Boris. Or, suppose that Xerxes, a defendant, asserts a proper crossclaim against Zelda, a codefendant, that is, a claim arising from the same occurrence as the main lawsuit. Once he has properly made Zelda an adversary under Rule 13(a), Rule 18(a) says Xerxes may add on other claims he has against Zelda.

But in many cases the defendant already knows that suit is being filed or can easily be given notice without the formality of service under the Federal Rules. So Rule 4 provides a method for a defendant to waive compliance with formal service requirements. Rule 4(d) authorizes a plaintiff to send the defendant a notice of the action and request that she waive service of process. A request for waiver must be addressed to the defendant (or, for a corporate defendant, an appropriate officer or managing agent or other agent authorized to receive process), and provide the name of the court in which the suit is pending, a copy of the complaint, two copies of the waiver form, and a stamped envelope to send it back. It must inform the defendant of the consequences of waiving service and of not waiving it, state the date of the request, give at least 30 days to return the waiver, and be sent by \u2018\u2018first-class mail or other reliable means.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1). Rule 4(d)(1) provides that the defendant has a duty to avoid unnecessary costs of service, and Rule 4(d)(2) tells her what will happen if she fails to fulfill that duty: She will have to pay the costs of formal service and any motion necessary to collect those costs. That isn\u2019t too scary, because the cost of service is not going to break the bank. But the rule makers cleverly provided a carrot as well as a stick: Rule 4(d)(3) provides that a defendant who waives formal service gets 60 days to file an answer, rather than the usual 21. For busy lawyers, that\u2019s a real incentive. So waiver is a genteel alternative to formal service and will frequently happen, but not always. Rule 4(d) does not expressly tell us what a plaintiff should do if the defendant does not waive service. But it provides that the penalty for failure to waive is to pay the cost of formal service (Rule 4(d)(2)), clearly implying that if the defendant does not waive service, the plaintiff must serve her with a copy of the summons and complaint through one of the formal methods provided in Rule 4.

Here\u2019s a question that illustrates the point.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Answers and objections. Creasey sues Trinh in federal court in Florida for injuries suffered in an accident in Alabama. Trinh files an answer to the complaint, including in the answer to an allegation that the court lacks personal jurisdiction over her. The objection to personal jurisdiction\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nis proper, and will be considered and decided by the court.\n\nAnalysis:\n A is right. It is perfectly appropriate for the defendant to respond by answering the complaint, and to include in that answer any objections she has, including those listed in Rule 12(b). \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nAll of this is fairly technical, though important. But in many cases the defendant already knows that suit is being filed or can easily be given notice without the formality of service under the Federal Rules. So Rule 4 provides a method for a defendant to waive compliance with formal service requirements. Rule 4(d) authorizes a plaintiff to send the defendant a notice of the action and request that she waive service of process. A request for waiver must be addressed to the defendant (or, for a corporate defendant, an appropriate officer or managing agent or other agent authorized to receive process), and provide the name of the court in which the suit is pending, a copy of the complaint, two copies of the waiver form, and a stamped envelope to send it back. It must inform the defendant of the consequences of waiving service and of not waiving it, state the date of the request, give at least 30 days to return the waiver, and be sent by \u2018\u2018first-class mail or other reliable means.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1). Rule 4(d)(1) provides that the defendant has a duty to avoid unnecessary costs of service, and Rule 4(d)(2) tells her what will happen if she fails to fulfill that duty: She will have to pay the costs of formal service and any motion necessary to collect those costs. That isn\u2019t too scary, because the cost of service is not going to break the bank. But the rule makers cleverly provided a carrot as well as a stick: Rule 4(d)(3) provides that a defendant who waives formal service gets 60 days to file an answer, rather than the usual 21. For busy lawyers, that\u2019s a real incentive. So waiver is a genteel alternative to formal service and will frequently happen, but not always. Rule 4(d) does not expressly tell us what a plaintiff should do if the defendant does not waive service. But it provides that the penalty for failure to waive is to pay the cost of formal service (Rule 4(d)(2)), clearly implying that if the defendant does not waive service, the plaintiff must serve her with a copy of the summons and complaint through one of the formal methods provided in Rule 4. So, consider these scenarios.\n\nQuestion:\n8. Technical fouls. Eban brings suit against Lorenzo for interference with business relations. Eban\u2019s lawyer, Darrow, calls Lorenzo\u2019s lawyer, Sadecki, and tells her that he is filing suit that afternoon. In which of the following scenarios may the case proceed without formal service of process?\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nDarrow files the complaint with the district court clerk with an affidavit swearing that he informed Sadecki of the case and mailed her a copy of the complaint.\n\nAnalysis:\nService is a formal act by which a court asserts its authority over the defendant. The cases require that it be done by the book in order to acquire that authority. Knowledge of the action by the defendant or someone who works for it will not substitute for formal submission to the court\u2019s authority through service (or a proper waiver). So we have to see if the defendant has properly waived service in any of these cases. In A, Darrow has attested to telling Lorenzo\u2019s counsel about the case. But he hasn\u2019t served him with process, and he hasn\u2019t complied with the Rule 4(d) procedure for waiving it. The court has not acquired jurisdiction over Lorenzo. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments. They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important question: What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).)\n\nQuestion:\n1. Triggering Rule 11. Which of the following acts might subject a litigant to sanctions under Rule 11?\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nA lawyer files a complaint seeking damages for medical expenses her client claims to have suffered, without seeking any evidence from the client that she incurred those expenses.\n\nAnalysis:\nRule 11 does not apply to all acts in the course of litigation, or even to most. It applies only to representations made before the court. The first sentence of Rule 11(b) makes that clear: The certifications under the Rule apply when a lawyer or unrepresented party \u2018\u2018present[s] to the court a pleading, written motion, or other paper\u2014whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating\u2019\u2019 that submission. In the question, only D involves such a filing. By filing the complaint, Middleton \u2018\u2018presented to the court\u2019\u2019 the demand for medical expenses. That act of filing the pleading triggers the representations in Rule 11(b) about positions taken in that pleading. If the claim for medical expenses is unsupported, and Middleton did not take adequate steps to determine whether there is support for it, she can be sanctioned for submitting it to the court.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments.
