FALSE POSITIVE ACTUAL 

Introduction:
Let’s consider the joinder question from the point of view of the third- party defendant. Once brought in, she may have some claims of her own. Of course, the rulemakers considered this possibility, and dealt with it in Rule 14(a). The preceding discussion, and the various subsections of Rule 14(a) itself, should provide all the information you need to address the following tidbit.

Question:
7. More slings and arrows. Clear Code Software agreed to create a litigation-support computer program for Holmes, a lawyer. It contracted out the writing of the code to Jasper, a Caltech grad student. Jasper wrote the code using a computer he rented from High Tech Rentals, Inc. He delivered the code to Clear Code, which put the program together and delivered it to Holmes, who claimed that it never worked properly and didn’t pay for it. Holmes sued Clear Code for breach of contract in federal court. (Assume that there are no subject matter jurisdiction problems with the action.) Clear Code in turn asserted a claim against Jasper, claiming that (while it was liable for Jasper’s work) the problem resulted from his faulty programming, so that he should end up absorbing the loss. Jasper then asserted five claims. His first claim was a quantum meruit claim against Holmes for the value of the services he rendered in preparing the computer program. The second was a claim for defamation against Holmes, for claiming to Clear Code that his programming work was ‘‘abominable.’’ His third claim was against High Tech, claiming that a glitch in the computer they rented to him caused the problem in the code, causing the Holmes program to fail. Jasper alleged that, if he was liable to Clear Code, then High Tech, as the cause of the defect in the program, should end up absorbing the damages. Fourth, he asserted a claim against Clear Code, the defendant, for the fee he had been promised for preparing the Holmes code, and another for his fee for an unrelated job.

Answer Candidate:
Of Jasper’s two claims against Clear Code only the one for the Holmes job is proper under the rules.

Analysis:
B asserts that Jasper’s first claim against Clear Code, for the contract price for the job, is a proper claim, but that his other claim, for the fee on an unrelated job, is improper. This isn’t right. Both claims are counterclaims, the first, compulsory, the second, permissive. Rule 13(a) (1) requires Jasper to assert claims he has against an opposing party (here, the defendant/third-party plaintiff, Clear Code) if they arise from the same events as the main claim. The claim for Jasper’s fee clearly does, so it is a compulsory counterclaim. His claim for his fee on another job is a permissive counterclaim under Rule 13(b) (though it might also be characterized as an added claim under Rule 18(a)). There could be jurisdictional problems with it, but there’s none under the joinder rules. An unrelated claim against an opposing party may be asserted under Rule 13(b).

Introduction:
If a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement? Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This ‘‘aggregation’’ problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot ‘‘aggregate’’ claims against different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a ‘‘common, undivided interest.’’ (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. §1367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. §1367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at Chapter 14, pp. 279-283. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.  Frequently, a plaintiff sues two or more defendants on a tort claim for injuries arguably worth more than $75,000. Suppose, for example, that Epstein suffers nerve damage during surgery, and that the damages are $90,000. He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith’s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe’s fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe ‘‘jointly and severally liable’’ for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence. But the amount requirement would be met in either type of jurisdiction. As long as either defendant might be held liable for the full $90,000, that amount is ‘‘in controversy’’ between her and the plaintiff. Since either Smith or Doe might be found solely at fault, either might be held liable for the full $90,000. To illustrate: 

Question:
11. Stooges do the math. In which of the following cases can all the claims properly be brought in federal court (assume that the traditional aggregation rules apply)?

Answer Candidate:
Larry (from New York) sues Curly (from Iowa) for his injuries in an accident, seeking $60,000. Curly counterclaims for $100,000 for his injuries.

Analysis:
B is no good either. The amount requirement must be assessed based only on the plaintiff’s claim, without regard to the value of any counterclaim. If Curly had brought the initial suit (and the claim for $100,000 were colorable), the court would have had jurisdiction. But Larry brought it, and sues for less, so his claim does not support original jurisdiction.

Introduction:
A frequent claim preclusion scenario involves a plaintiff who sues in federal court on federal claims, and then brings a later action in state court on related state law claims. This scenario is different from the previous examples, because it involves a court in one system determining what res judicata effect to give to the decision of a court in a different system. These ‘‘intersystem preclusion’’ issues can be complex. But a fair working rule is that a court in one system will give the same res judicata effect to a judgment that it would be given in the court that rendered it. See Friedenthal, Kane & Miller, Civil Procedure 682-684 (5th ed. 2015). Thus, a state court, confronted with a decision of a federal court, will ask, ‘‘could the plaintiff have gone back and tried again in federal court?’’ If she could not have tried again in the rendering court, she will almost always be barred from trying again in another court, in either the state or federal system. Similarly, a federal court, confronted with a second action after a previous action in state court, will apply the claim preclusion rules of the state court that rendered the previous decision. On that premise, consider the following two examples. Keep in mind that the federal courts follow the Second Restatement approach to claim preclusion problems.

Question:
7. Round One. Pelham sues Correro, a police officer who arrested him. He brings suit in federal court under 42 U.S.C. §1983, a federal statute that authorizes suits against persons acting on behalf of the state for violation of federal civil rights. Pelham alleges that Correro’s conduct in using excessive force in making the arrest violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He loses, because the federal court determines that Correro is entitled to qualified immunity from liability on the federal civil rights claim. Subsequently, Pelham sues Correro in state court for assault and battery, based on the same conduct that gave rise to his federal civil rights action. Assume that the state court uses a narrower, ‘‘primary rights’’ approach to claim preclusion, that the assault and battery claims, under that approach, would be viewed as based on different primary rights from the federal civil rights claim and could be brought in a separate action. Pelham’s second action

Answer Candidate:
will not be barred, because the state court will view his assault and battery claims as based on different primary rights from the claims asserted in his first action.

Analysis:
D also fails, because the Emporia court will not ask whether Emporia’s res judicata principles would bar a second action, but rather whether federal res judicata principles would. Once again, the second court, even in a different state or a different court system, will usually look to the preclusion principles of the rendering court, not its own. Since Pelham could not have brought a second action in federal court, under our ‘‘working rule’’ that the second court looks to the preclusion law of the first, he cannot bring it in state court either.

Introduction:
Necessary-to-the-judgment hypos make natural closers, because they are so difficult for students to grasp. This requirement seems arbitrary and technical, even silly. But let’s try to understand why courts have consistently included this mysterious limitation on collateral estoppel. Cambria v. Jeffrey, 307 Mass. 49 (1940), provides a classic example of the problem. In slightly simplified form, the facts were as follows: Cambria had an accident with Jeffrey and sued Jeffrey for negligence in causing his injuries. Jeffrey pleaded contributory negligence. At the time of this crusty case, contributory negligence of a plaintiff barred recovery entirely, even if the defendant was negligent too. The case was tried before a judge, not a jury. The judge found that Cambria was negligent, and that Jeffrey was negligent as well. Question: What judgment should the judge enter based on these factual findings? He should dismiss Cambria’s suit. Under the contributory negligence doctrine, a plaintiff who was partially at fault in causing the accident could not recover. The plaintiff had to be blameless to recover, and Cambria was negligent, so he lost. But that wasn’t the end of it. After the judge dismissed Cambria’s suit, Jeffrey sued Cambria for his injuries. (At the time Massachusetts had no compulsory counterclaim rule, so Jeffrey had not waived his claim by failing to assert it in the first action.) Predictably, Cambria pleaded that Jeffrey was contributorily negligent, and asserted that Jeffrey was estopped from denying his negligence, since the judge in the first suit had found that he was. This isn’t a bad argument; the parties litigated Jeffrey’s negligence in Suit One, and the judge decided that he was negligent, so why should Jeffrey be allowed to litigate it again? Despite this logic, the court in Cambria v. Jeffrey held that Jeffrey could litigate it again, because the judge’s finding in the first suit that Jeffrey was negligent was not ‘‘necessary to the judgment.’’ Question: What finding was necessary to the judgment in Suit One? Why did Cambria lose? If you think about it, it’s clear that Cambria did not lose because Jeffrey was negligent . . . that finding would tend to support liability! No, he lost because he (Cambria) was negligent. At the time, a contributorily negligent plaintiff could not win, whether the defendant was negligent or not. Thus, Cambria’s negligence led to the judgment, but the finding that Jeffrey was negligent was irrelevant to the outcome in the first action. Because the judge in the first action never had to decide whether Jeffrey was negligent, that finding was a form of dicta. The finding didn’t affect the outcome, so the judge may not have given it the same serious consideration he would have if it would affect the result. Thus, we can’t have quite the level of confidence in this irrelevant conclusion that we have in a finding that leads to the judgment in the case. There’s another problem with findings that don’t lead to the judgment. They are, usually, unreviewable: Question: Put yourself in Jeffrey’s shoes. The judge has found him negligent. He contemplates a suit against Cambria for his own injuries in the accident. What would he want to do if he feared that he would be estopped from relitigating his negligence in the second action? Naturally, if Jeffrey fears being stuck with the finding that he was negligent, he would want to appeal it and get it reversed, so it would not come back to haunt him in his later suit for his own injuries. Question: If Jeffrey appealed the judge’s finding in the first action that he was negligent, what would the appellate court do? Very likely, the appellate court would say, ‘‘What are you doing here, Jeffrey? You won below. Why should we review the finding that you were negligent? The issue is moot. Even if we agreed with you, it wouldn’t change the outcome, so why should we waste our time reviewing an irrelevant conclusion?’’ And how could they meaningfully review it? If Jeffrey appealed, why would Cambria spend the money to oppose the appeal? He lost anyway, he isn’t likely to litigate an appeal about Jeffrey’s negligence out of pure curiosity. So, Jeffrey would probably not be able to obtain appellate review of the trial judge’s finding that he was negligent. Since the finding did not affect the outcome, and can’t be corrected on appeal, most courts would not give collateral estoppel effect to it. The trick, of course, is to distinguish such miscellaneous findings from those that do affect the outcome, that are ‘‘necessary to the judgment.’’ Consider this case.

Question:
9. Triple play. Perez sues the City of Atlantis, alleging that the mayor violated his First Amendment rights by demoting him from his city job to a lower-paying one because he had supported Appolonia, the losing candidate for mayor in the 2018 election. The City raises three defenses. It denies that Perez was demoted, arguing that he was transferred to an equivalent position. Second, it claims that the mayor never believed that Perez supported Appolonia, so could not have discriminated against him on that basis. Last, it claims that Perez had waived any claim for demotion when he agreed to accept his new position. The case went to trial on all three issues. The jury rendered a general verdict, finding the City liable to Perez for violating his First Amendment rights. A year later, Perez is fired. He sues again, claiming that he was fired in violation of his First Amendment rights, because the mayor believed he had supported Appolonia in the 2018 election.

Answer Candidate:
Perez may not estop the City from relitigating whether the mayor believed that Perez had supported Appolonia. Since the City raised three defenses, we cannot tell which findings were necessary to the judgment in the first case.

Analysis:
So we know what they decided on each of these issues. Which of these findings was necessary to the judgment? They all were. The jury had to reject all three defenses in order to render a verdict for Perez. They couldn’t find for Perez without rejecting all three defenses. If, for example, they had found that the mayor had not believed that Perez had supported Appolonia, they would not have awarded damages for violation of his First Amendment rights in demoting him for it. Consequently, their finding on this issue was necessary to the outcome in the first suit. And the same is true of the other two defenses. Thus, C is wrong, because, if the jury had reached a different result on any one of these three defenses, the City would have won. But it didn’t, so the jury must have rejected them all, and rejecting all three led to the verdict they returned. Here, it’s B as in ‘‘Best.’’

Introduction:
The cases we’ve analyzed so far have involved situations in which one of the parties to Suit One invokes collateral estoppel in a later action between the same parties. Suppose, for example, that Smith sues Doe, and loses on Issue A. The same issue then arises again in a later suit between Smith and Doe, and Doe invokes collateral estoppel to bar Smith from relitigating it. This is a case of ‘‘mutual collateral estoppel,’’ because Doe, the party invoking estoppel in the second action was a party to the first, litigated it against Smith in that action, and prevailed on the issue in Suit One. However, an issue previously litigated and decided may arise in later litigation involving a new party as well. Suppose, for example, that Forrestal Corporation sues Quantum Software for infringing its patent, and loses because the jury finds that the patent is invalid. Subsequently, Forrestal sues Apex Corporation for infringing on the patent. Apex would like to invoke collateral estoppel, arguing that Forrestal litigated and lost on the patent issue in Suit One and should not be able to relitigate the issue. Under traditional principles of collateral estoppel, Apex could not invoke estoppel, because it was not a party to the first suit. Under the ‘‘mutuality’’ doctrine, which still reigns in some jurisdictions, only the parties to the first action could invoke estoppel based on findings in that action. Apex, a stranger to Suit One, could not step in and use the finding from that suit to bar Forrestal from relitigating the validity issue. Other courts have moved away from mutuality, recognizing that, under some conditions, allowing a new party to invoke estoppel is fair. The key case on the point is Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979), in which the Supreme Court cautiously authorized federal trial judges to apply non-mutual estoppel in circumstances that ensure that the issue was fairly decided in the first action. However, while the federal courts and a good many state courts now allow non-mutual estoppel, all courts adhere to a fundamental requirement: that the party who is being estopped must have litigated and lost on the issue in the prior suit. The party invoking estoppel may be new, but the party who is barred from relitigating must have had its fair bite at the apple in the first suit. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be fair to invoke estoppel to bar her from litigating the issue. In analyzing a non-mutual preclusion problem, start by asking who litigated the issues in the prior action. In a mutuality jurisdiction, only those parties may use estoppel in a later action. In a non-mutuality jurisdiction, estoppel can be used against a party who litigated and lost on an issue in the first suit. Here’s a case that makes the point.

Question:
10. First Principles. Gotchall invested one million dollars with Faithful Investments Inc., on the basis of a brochure describing its mutual fund. Later, he sued Faithful in federal court. He claimed that Faithful’s brochure promised a return of at least 15 percent. Faithful denied this, arguing that the materials were ambiguous about the likely return. After a trial without a jury, the judge found that the brochure did not guarantee any particular rate of return. She therefore entered judgment dismissing Gotschall’s claim for damages. Later, Carmichael, who had also invested in the fund, sued Faithful for damages, basing his claim on the same argument as Gotschall’s, that Faithful’s brochure promised a return of at least 15 percent. Faithful moves for summary judgment, arguing that Carmichael is estopped from proving that the brochure misrepresented the likely return, since the judge had found for Faithful on the issue in the first suit. The court should hold that Carmichael’s claim

Answer Candidate:
is barred, because the issue was litigated in the prior action, decided in favor of Faithful, and the issue was necessary to the judgment in the prior action.

Analysis:
B argues that he is barred because the requirements for collateral estoppel are met—the issue is the same, it was actually litigated in suit one and decided by the court. All that is true . . . but it was not litigated by Carmichael. Due process of law requires that he have his bite at the apple before he is estopped on the issue, and he hasn’t had it. This is indeed a ‘‘first principle’’: No party will be estopped (absent some form of privity) until she has had her day in court. My students frequently lose sight of this fundamental, ineluctable requirement for applying issue preclusion. Always ask whether the party who is being barred from litigating the issue litigated it before. If not, no estoppel! Estoppel—in a mutuality jurisdiction or in a non-mutuality jurisdiction—only bars a party from relitigating an issue, not from litigating it for the first time.

Introduction:
Let’s consider one more example that concerns the relation between minimum contacts and litigation convenience.

Question:
10. Cold, cruel world. Mary Smith, a divorced, working-class woman of fifty-five, lives in Massachusetts. She doesn’t have enough money to travel ordinarily but saved her pennies to attend her daughter’s wedding in California. While there, she rented a car to get to the ceremony and had an accident with an Exxon Mobil oil truck. Exxon Mobil, a huge multinational corporation, does business in all states and has a large corporate office in Massachusetts. After Mary returns to Massachusetts, Exxon Mobil sues her in a California state court for the damage to its truck. Mary

Answer Candidate:
has minimum contacts with California that gave rise to the claim, but it would not be reasonable to force her to defend the action in California, given Exxon Mobil’s ample resources to bring suit in Massachusetts.

Analysis:
C suggests that a defendant can avoid personal jurisdiction in a state by arguing that it would be more convenient for the plaintiff to come to her than for her to go to the defendant. This comparative balancing analysis isn’t supported by the Supreme Court’s cases on personal jurisdiction, although occasionally ‘‘inconvenience’’ goes into the analysis. The Court’s cases ask whether the plaintiff has chosen a forum that is acceptable under due process analysis, given the defendant’s contacts and a number of reasonableness factors, not whether an alternative forum would be more convenient for the defendant than the one the plaintiff has chosen.

Introduction:
Over the years from Pennoyer v. Neff to Shaffer v. Heitner, attachment jurisdiction was widely invoked to support jurisdiction over unrelated claims. It was routinely used, for example, to attach intangible assets, such as bank deposits. This expanded the doctrine beyond its traditional roots, which involved physical control of physical assets. It is harder to think of a bank account, which is a contractual right to repayment of the deposited amount, as physically ‘‘present’’ in a particular place. Harris v. Balk, 198 U.S. 215 (1905), was an extreme example of the use of attachment jurisdiction to seize an intangible asset. In Harris, Epstein, a Maryland citizen with a claim against Balk, learned that Harris, who owed money to Balk, was coming to Maryland. Epstein sued Balk in Maryland, and obtained a writ of attachment for the seizure of Harris’s debt to Balk. He then served the writ on Harris while he was in Maryland. The Supreme Court concluded that Harris’s debt to Balk traveled with him, so that it could be ‘‘seized’’ in Maryland while Harris was there, and disposed of by order of the Maryland court. This was an exercise of attachment, or quasi in rem type II jurisdiction, because Harris’s debt to Balk was completely unrelated to Epstein’s claim against Balk. It simply provided an unrelated asset that could be seized by the court and used to satisfy Epstein’s claim. Shaffer involved a similarly extreme exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction. Heitner sued officers and directors of Greyhound Company in Delaware, asserting a claim arising out of alleged mismanagement of the company’s business in Oregon. Many of the defendants had not acted in Delaware, and had no other connection to Delaware that would support personal jurisdiction over them there. But many of them owned Greyhound stock. And Delaware had a statute that declared all shares of stock in Delaware corporations to be present in Delaware. Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8, §169 (1975). So, Heitner sought—and was granted—a court order seizing (‘‘sequestering’’) the Greyhound stock owned by the defendants. Here, as in Harris v. Balk, Heitner did not claim any preexisting ownership interest in the stock itself. Rather, he sought to adjudicate an unrelated claim that arose in Oregon based on the court’s seizure of these intangible assets. Like the plaintiff’s ploy in Harris, this was an exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction—very type II. In Shaffer, the Court held that the artificial distinction between exercising jurisdiction over the defendant and exercising jurisdiction over his property in quasi in rem type II cases ‘‘supports an ancient form without substantial modern justification.’’ 433 U.S. at 212. Because taking the defendants’ property was merely an ‘‘elliptical way’’ of asserting jurisdiction over the defendants themselves, the Court broadly concluded that it could only be asserted under the same standards: ‘‘We therefore conclude that all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in International Shoe and its progeny.’’ 433 U.S. at 212. If this broad language from Shaffer means what it says, it would allow the assertion of attachment jurisdiction only when the defendant could personally be sued in the state for the underlying claim, under in personam jurisdiction standards. For the moment, let’s take the broad holding quoted above at face value. On that assumption, consider the following example.

Question:
6. Shaffer survivors? In which of the following cases could the court properly assert jurisdiction, after the Supreme Court’s decision in Shaffer v. Heitner?

Answer Candidate:
Ohora is injured when she falls in a hole while crossing the lawn in front of Roux’s summer house in Nebraska. She sues Roux in Nebraska for her injuries and asserts jurisdiction by obtaining a writ of attachment on the property on which she was injured.

Analysis:
In his majority opinion, Justice Marshall suggested that exercises of in rem jurisdiction would have to be measured by the same standards as exercises of in personam jurisdiction. Thus, attachment jurisdiction is not dead. It is constitutionally permissible for a court to exercise jurisdiction based on an attachment . . . if it could assert jurisdiction over the defendant personally for the claim plaintiff seeks to adjudicate. So, to decide whether the above in rem cases are still permissible, we must ask whether the plaintiff could have sued the defendant for the same claim in an in personam action. In A, the plaintiff was injured on the defendant’s property and seeks to recover for the injury. This claim arises out of the ownership and maintenance of real property in the state. Since it arises from a significant in-state contact of Roux in Nebraska—maintenance of his property there—he could be sued for it in Nebraska based on specific in personam jurisdiction. Thus, this exercise of jurisdiction meets International Shoe jurisdictional standards, and Ohora may proceed by attaching the property under an attachment statute if she chooses to do so. In Shaffer, Justice Marshall notes that the minimum contacts test will usually be met in such cases. See 433 U.S. at 208. One might legitimately wonder why Ohora would choose to proceed by attachment, which only brings the defendant’s property before the court, rather than suing Roux in personam, which would support a personal judgment for the full amount of Ohora’s injuries. Presumably, Ohora would sue in personam in most cases. She might proceed by attachment, however, if the state long-arm statute did not authorize personal jurisdiction under the circumstances, yet the attachment statute authorized attachment of the defendant’s in-state assets. For an example of such a case, see Intermeat Inc. v. American Poultry Inc., 575 F.2d 1017 (2d Cir. 1978).

Question:
6. Shaffer survivors? In which of the following cases could the court properly assert jurisdiction, after the Supreme Court’s decision in Shaffer v. Heitner?

Answer Candidate:
Ohora brings an action to quiet title to her Nebraska farm in a Nebraska court. She gives notice of the action by mail to Roux, who lives in New York but claims a one-third interest in the farm inherited from a great aunt. She also gives notice by publication to unknown claimants to the property.

Analysis:
B is a ‘‘pure’’ in rem action to quiet title to real property. Under the broad holding of the Shaffer majority, such actions would have to meet the personal jurisdiction standards of International Shoe. And they usually would, since the suit involves title to property within the forum state. Because it arises from ownership of an interest in land in Nebraska, claimants to the property will have a minimum contact in Nebraska that gives rise to the claim. Since the court could proceed in personam, it may proceed based on jurisdiction over the property instead. This one is OK. The trend seems pretty clear here, doesn’t it.

Heitner sued officers and directors of Greyhound Company in Delaware, asserting a claim arising out of alleged mismanagement of the company’s business in Oregon. Many of the defendants had not acted in Delaware, and had no other connection to Delaware that would support personal jurisdiction over them there. But many of them owned Greyhound stock. And Delaware had a statute that declared all shares of stock in Delaware corporations to be present in Delaware. Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8, §169 (1975). So, Heitner sought—and was granted—a court order seizing (‘‘sequestering’’) the Greyhound stock owned by the defendants. Here, as in Harris v. Balk, Heitner did not claim any preexisting ownership interest in the stock itself. Rather, he sought to adjudicate an unrelated claim that arose in Oregon based on the court’s seizure of these intangible assets. Like the plaintiff’s ploy in Harris, this was an exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction—very type II. In Shaffer, the Court held that the artificial distinction between exercising jurisdiction over the defendant and exercising jurisdiction over his property in quasi in rem type II cases ‘‘supports an ancient form without substantial modern justification.’’ 433 U.S. at 212. Because taking the defendants’ property was merely an ‘‘elliptical way’’ of asserting jurisdiction over the defendants themselves, the Court broadly concluded that it could only be asserted under the same standards: ‘‘We therefore conclude that all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in International Shoe and its progeny.’’ 433 U.S. at 212. If this broad language from Shaffer means what it says, it would allow the assertion of attachment jurisdiction only when the defendant could personally be sued in the state for the underlying claim, under in personam jurisdiction standards. For the moment, let’s take the broad holding quoted above at face value. On that assumption, consider the following example.

Question:
6. Shaffer survivors? In which of the following cases could the court properly assert jurisdiction, after the Supreme Court’s decision in Shaffer v. Heitner?

Answer Candidate:
Consolidated Equipment Company sells Roux a construction crane in Iowa, on an installment contract, subject to a right of repossession for nonpayment. Roux fails to pay. Consolidated brings an action in Nebraska to obtain clear title to the crane, and obtains a writ from the court attaching the crane while present on a job in Nebraska.

Analysis:
C is an exercise of quasi in rem type I jurisdiction. Here again, the claim is to property present in the forum. Since the case involves conflicting ownership interests in property in Nebraska, the court would quite likely have jurisdiction over the claimants under the minimum contacts test.

Introduction:
All of this is fairly technical, though important. But in many cases the defendant already knows that suit is being filed or can easily be given notice without the formality of service under the Federal Rules. So Rule 4 provides a method for a defendant to waive compliance with formal service requirements. Rule 4(d) authorizes a plaintiff to send the defendant a notice of the action and request that she waive service of process. A request for waiver must be addressed to the defendant (or, for a corporate defendant, an appropriate officer or managing agent or other agent authorized to receive process), and provide the name of the court in which the suit is pending, a copy of the complaint, two copies of the waiver form, and a stamped envelope to send it back. It must inform the defendant of the consequences of waiving service and of not waiving it, state the date of the request, give at least 30 days to return the waiver, and be sent by ‘‘first-class mail or other reliable means.’’ Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(1). Rule 4(d)(1) provides that the defendant has a duty to avoid unnecessary costs of service, and Rule 4(d)(2) tells her what will happen if she fails to fulfill that duty: She will have to pay the costs of formal service and any motion necessary to collect those costs. That isn’t too scary, because the cost of service is not going to break the bank. But the rule makers cleverly provided a carrot as well as a stick: Rule 4(d)(3) provides that a defendant who waives formal service gets 60 days to file an answer, rather than the usual 21. For busy lawyers, that’s a real incentive. So waiver is a genteel alternative to formal service and will frequently happen, but not always. Rule 4(d) does not expressly tell us what a plaintiff should do if the defendant does not waive service. But it provides that the penalty for failure to waive is to pay the cost of formal service (Rule 4(d)(2)), clearly implying that if the defendant does not waive service, the plaintiff must serve her with a copy of the summons and complaint through one of the formal methods provided in Rule 4. So, consider these scenarios.

Question:
8. Technical fouls. Eban brings suit against Lorenzo for interference with business relations. Eban’s lawyer, Darrow, calls Lorenzo’s lawyer, Sadecki, and tells her that he is filing suit that afternoon. In which of the following scenarios may the case proceed without formal service of process?

Answer Candidate:
Darrow files the complaint and mails a copy of it by first class mail to Lorenzo with two copies of a proper request for waiver. He files an affidavit with the court attesting to those acts.

Analysis:
He has been sloppy in B as well. A waiver is not obtained by sending a request for it, even if it includes all the information required in Rule 4(d)(1). A waiver is obtained when the defendant signs and returns the waiver form. Nothing indicates that Lorenzo did that in B.
