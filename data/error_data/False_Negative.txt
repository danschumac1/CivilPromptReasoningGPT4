FALSE NEGATIVE ACTUAL

Introduction:
In federal court, the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is governed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). Rule 50(b) provides that, if a motion for a judgment as a matter of law is denied, the motion may be renewed no later than twenty-eight days after entry of judgment. This establishes two prerequisites for the motion. First, it must be made within twenty-eight days after judgment is entered on the jury’s verdict for the plaintiff. Second, the party moving for judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) before the case went to the jury. There is an important practical reason for the requirement that a party who seeks judgment notwithstanding the verdict must have moved for a judgment before the case is submitted to the jury. A party seeking judgment as a matter of law before the case goes to the jury must state the grounds for her position that the plaintiff’s case is too weak. In Question 1, for example, Vicaro would state as grounds for the motion the lack of evidence of the relevant standard of medical care, that his treatment fell below that standard of care, or that his treatment caused Powers’s condition. Now (while it’s unlikely with such a glaring omission), it may be that Powers has this evidence and simply neglected to introduce it. If that is true, Vicaro’s motion acts as a wake-up call to Powers’s lawyer. When the defendant points out the gap in her evidence, she will ask the judge to allow her to reopen her case to offer the omitted evidence. Since a trial is a quest for truth rather than a game of skill, the judge should allow her to do so, absent unfair surprise to Vicaro. So, by requiring the challenge to the sufficiency of the plaintiff’s case at a point where the omission can be remedied, Rule 50(b) facilitates the trial of the case on the merits. In the federal courts, there is a second reason for the prior-motion requirement in order to move for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The Supreme Court held, in a dubious decision, that reconsidering the jury’s verdict violates the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial, unless the judge reserved the right to do so on a motion made before the case went to the jury. Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. Redman, 295 U.S. 654 (1935). Consider how the prior-motion rule should apply in the following case.

Question:
7. Second time around. Uberoth, a venture capitalist, sues Colon, an investment broker, in federal court. He alleges that Colon fraudulently induced Uberoth to invest in an internet start-up company, by knowingly making false statements about its prospects and the backgrounds of its officers. The case goes to trial. At the close of the evidence, Colon moves for a judgment as a matter of law, on the ground that Uberoth has not produced enough evidence to support a verdict that Colon knew, at the time he made the statements, that they were false. The judge denies the motion, and the jury subsequently returns a verdict finding Colon liable for the misrepresentation. After the jury’s verdict, but before a judgment has been entered on the verdict, Colon moves for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. He argues that Uberoth had produced no evidence that he had actually relied on Colon’s statements about the company’s prospects in making his investment. Reliance on the defendant’s misrepresentation is a required element of a claim for negligent misrepresentation. The trial judge should

Answer Candidate:
deny Colon’s motion, since it was made on a different ground from that raised in Colon’s prior motion for judgment as a matter of law.

Analysis:
So B is the right answer here; the motion will be denied based on Colon’s failure to raise this challenge to Uberoth’s proof before the case went to the jury.

Introduction:
This is not the place to go into supplemental jurisdiction in detail—we’ll do that in Chapter 14. But it is useful to introduce the problem of cases that include some claims that satisfy federal subject matter jurisdiction, but also others that do not. Very commonly, cases involve not one claim, but several—perhaps two, or perhaps ten. Civil procedure has a nasty doctrine called res judicata, which provides that once you have sued a defendant for claims arising out of a set of events, you can’t do it again. Consequently, lawyers know that whatever claims they have against a defendant arising from a particular dispute must be asserted when they bring suit the first time. Suppose, for example, that Greenstein, a New Yorker, sues Panil, another New Yorker, for infringing her patent, claiming that she had licensed Panil to use the patented device for limited purposes, but Panil had exceeded those limits. This claim arises under the federal patent statutes, so the federal court has arising-under jurisdiction to hear it. However, Greenstein might also allege a claim for breach of contract as well, based on the same acts by Panil. This is a state claim between two parties from the same state. It doesn’t arise under federal law, and there’s no diversity. If it were brought alone, the federal court would not have jurisdiction to hear it. But it wasn’t brought alone; it was brought along with a proper federal claim and arises from the same events. It makes sense that it should be litigated along with the federal claim. But how can it be? Subject matter jurisdiction is fundamental, and what gives the federal court subject matter jurisdiction over Greenstein’s contract claim? The Supreme Court has held that where the plaintiff asserts a claim that properly supports federal court jurisdiction, it is constitutionally permissible for the federal court to hear the entire dispute between the parties, including other claims that arise from the same ‘‘nucleus of operative facts’’ but could not be brought in federal court alone. United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715 (1966). And Congress has conveyed such ‘‘supplemental’’ jurisdiction to the federal district courts in 28 U.S.C. §1367(a), which authorizes the federal court, if it has jurisdiction over one claim, to hear other claims that are part of the same ‘‘case or controversy.’’ Basically, a claim is part of the same case or controversy as the main claim (the one that gives the federal court jurisdiction) if it arises from the same set of underlying facts, the ‘‘common nucleus of operative facts’’ test of Gibbs. So the bottom line is (a little oversimplified, but close enough until we get to Chapter 14) that a plaintiff who has asserted one substantial claim that properly invokes federal jurisdiction may have her entire dispute heard in federal court, including state law claims that couldn’t otherwise be brought in federal court. Here’s a basic illustration.

Question:
9. Tagging along. Isaacs, a Montana citizen, sues United Tool and Die Corporation, incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Montana, under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). He sues in federal court. Isaacs claims that United fired him because of his age, replacing him with a younger employee. Isaacs also asserts a second claim in his complaint, alleging that firing him constituted a breach of his contract of employment. He asserts a third claim in the complaint, alleging that, a year before he was fired, United had misappropriated a design he created for a new grinding wheel. Isaacs claimed he had invented the wheel on his own, not in the course of his employment, so that United had no right to exploit the idea without his consent. The federal court has subject matter jurisdiction

Answer Candidate:
over the first two claims, but not the third.

Analysis:
So D is the best answer. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over the breach of contract claim, because it arises from the same underlying dispute as the ADEA claim. But the misappropriation claim arises from other, only tangentially related events, and would not qualify under §1367 (or under U.M.W. v. Gibbs) for supplemental jurisdiction.
