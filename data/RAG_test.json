International incident.

Whitney, a Rhode Island citizen, goes skiing at a ski area in Vermont. When he purchases his lift ticket, he quickly signs a release of liability, waiving his right to sue, should he be injured due to negligence of the operator. While coming down an expert trail, he comes suddenly upon a bare spot full of rocks. He falls and is injured. He brings a diversity action against the operator in federal court in Rhode Island, basing personal jurisdiction on the fact that it had sent him an offer there for a weekend ski package that induced him to go to Vermont to ski. Assume that Rhode Island tort law refuses to enforce advance waivers of liability for negligence, unless they were individually negotiated. Assume further that Vermont tort law holds such waivers enforceable. Assume further that Rhode Island\u2019s choice-of-law rule for tort cases is to apply the law of the place of the injury, while Vermont\u2019s choice-of-law rule involves an assessment of the interests of the parties and states involved.

A matter of procedure? Columbus sues Moriarty in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Her claim is for an injury she suffered in Tennessee, when she was hit by a bullet fired by one of a group of hunters. Her injuries are grievous, so her damages evidence will be graphic and moving. There is a significant question in the case as to whether it was Moriarty who shot her.

He retains a lawyer, Pope, to bring suit against Adventure Vehicles, Inc., the company that manufactured the ORV. Pope files suit, seeking recovery on a theory of strict products liability, that is, that the defendant is liable without fault for selling a defective vehicle that injured Jhala. His theory is that the ORV was built with too narrow a wheelbase, making it dangerously prone to rolling over. He also asserts a negligence claim against Adventure, on the theory that it negligently designed the ORV. Adventure answers the complaint, denying that the ORV was defectively designed, denying that it was negligently designed, and alleging as an affirmative defense that Jhala was negligent for driving it too fast on a steep slope. After discovery based on these pleadings, the case goes to trial. To support its comparative negligence defense, Adventure presents evidence about Jhala\u2019s route at the time of the accident, his speed, and the slope of the hill where the accident occurred. Jhala introduces opposing evidence on these issues. After both parties have rested their cases, Adventure seeks a jury instruction on the theory of assumption of the risk. In the state where the action arose, assumption of the risk provides a complete defense to a product liability claim if the plaintiff fully understood a risk posed by a defective product and deliberately chose to encounter the risk anyway. Adventure moves to amend its answer under Rule 15(b)(1) to add a defense of assumption of the risk, so the jury can consider this defense. The judge should", "8. Ups and downs.

Reversal of fortune. Sardinha sues Knox in federal court for injuries in a plane crash. The case is tried to a jury. At the close of the evidence, Knox moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a). The motion is denied, and the jury returns a verdict for Sardinha. After the verdict, Knox moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), and, in the alternative, for a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence. He also seeks a new trial on the ground that the judge had given the jury the wrong instruction on causation. The judge rules as follows on Knox\u2019s motions. The defendant\u2019s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is granted, since the evidence that the accident resulted from the negligence of Knox is not sufficient to support a rational verdict.

For example, for many years the states used the \u2018\u2018lex loci delicti\u2019\u2019 choice-of-law rule in tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of injury, even if the suit were filed in a different state. Similarly, in contracts cases, traditional choice-of-law doctrine looked to the contract law of the place where the contract was formed. After Erie established that federal diversity courts had to apply state law, federal courts faced the further problem of choosing which state\u2019s law to use in a case like Erie.

Three years after Erie, the Supreme Court addressed this issue in Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941). Klaxon held that a federal diversity court should use the choice-of-law rules of the state in which it sits. Thus, a New York federal court should apply whatever state substantive law the New York state court would apply to the case. If a New York court, under its choice-of-law rules, would apply New York tort law to Tompkins\u2019s accident (even though it took place in Pennsylvania), the New York federal court should do so as well. On the other hand, if a New York court would, under its choice-of-law rule for torts, apply Pennsylvania law to Tompkins\u2019s case, the New York federal court should similarly look to Pennsylvania law. Klaxon reasoned that Erie required that the case come out the same way in federal court that it would in the state courts of the state where the federal court sat. To further that uniformity goal, the federal court should choose whatever body of tort law (or contract law or other state law) the local state court would. When Erie was decided, most courts applied the lex loci delicti choice of law rule to tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of the injury. Under the lex loci rule, there was little doubt that, if a New York state court heard Tompkins\u2019s case, it would apply Pennsylvania tort law to it. So a federal court in New York would also look to Pennsylvania tort law to decide the case. Today, however, states use widely divergent choice-of-law rules. One state might use the place-of-the-injury rule in a tort case, another might look to the interests of the various states connected to the case, and another state might apply its own law as long as the case has some connection to it. It is entirely possible, under this balkanized approach to choice of law, that a New York court would apply New York law to a case, even though, had the case been filed in Pennsylvania, that court would have chosen its law\u2014or that of a third state\u2014to govern the same case. Since New York courts and Pennsylvania courts might apply different bodies of tort law to a case, it follows, under Klaxon, that federal courts in those states might also end up applying different tort rules to the same dispute. If the New York federal court uses New York\u2019s choice of law rules to select the proper tort law (as it must under Klaxon), it might select New York law in a case like Tompkins\u2019s, because a New York state court would, under its choice-of-law rules. But, if Pennsylvania uses different choice of law rules, a Pennsylvania federal court using Pennsylvania choice of law rules might apply Pennsylvania law, if Tompkins sued there.

So, the bottom line is that a federal diversity court must apply whatever state law the courts of the state in which it sits would apply. In cases with connections to more than one state, this adds a second layer to the Erie analysis.", "All of the questions in this chapter are hard. The York/Hanna doctrine is hard. So the Closer here is just another Closer. Consider again the two prongs of the Hanna analysis in choosing the best answer.  That is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer. But Hanna changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In Hanna, Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule. York and Byrd both involved such conflicts. York involved a conflict between a state statute and the judicial practice of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And Byrd involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal judicial practice of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these \u2018\u2018relatively unguided\u2019\u2019 Erie conflicts, Hanna reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in Byrd\u2019s language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because \u2018\u2018there can be no other law.\u2019\u2019 Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury\u2019s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy Erie sought to further\u2014uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts\u2014but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the Hanna opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of York\u2019s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are not prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and \u2018\u2018inequitable administration of the laws,\u2019\u2019 that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York line of cases would not require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following Question 1.) That\u2019s Hanna Part I. It\u2019s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in Hanna, unlike in York or in Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna construed Congress\u2019s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is \u2018\u2018rationally capable of classification\u2019\u2019 as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the \u2018\u2018outcome-determinative\u2019\u2019 test of York, or the more refined outcome-determinative test of Hanna Part I. But the rule involved in Hanna wasn\u2019t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to \u2018\u2018prescribe general rules of practice and procedure\u2019\u2019 for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a). In Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress\u2019s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted \u00a72072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that \u2018\u2018really regulates procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\u2019\u2019 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress\u2019s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress\u2019s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court\u2019s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b) provides that the Rules \u2018\u2018shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u2019\u2019 Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, \u00a72072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \u00a72072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and\u2014even if it is\u2014it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the \u2018\u2018modified outcome-determinative test\u2019\u2019 of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the \u2018\u2018Supreme Law of the Land.\u2019\u2019 United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under Hanna Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under Hanna Part II? ", "All of the questions in this chapter are hard. The York/Hanna doctrine is hard. So the Closer here is just another Closer. Consider again the two prongs of the Hanna analysis in choosing the best answer.  That is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer. But Hanna changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In Hanna, Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule. York and Byrd both involved such conflicts. York involved a conflict between a state statute and the judicial practice of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And Byrd involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal judicial practice of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these \u2018\u2018relatively unguided\u2019\u2019 Erie conflicts, Hanna reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in Byrd\u2019s language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because \u2018\u2018there can be no other law.\u2019\u2019 Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury\u2019s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy Erie sought to further\u2014uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts\u2014but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the Hanna opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of York\u2019s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are not prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and \u2018\u2018inequitable administration of the laws,\u2019\u2019 that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York line of cases would not require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following Question 1.) That\u2019s Hanna Part I. It\u2019s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in Hanna, unlike in York or in Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna construed Congress\u2019s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is \u2018\u2018rationally capable of classification\u2019\u2019 as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the \u2018\u2018outcome-determinative\u2019\u2019 test of York, or the more refined outcome-determinative test of Hanna Part I. But the rule involved in Hanna wasn\u2019t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to \u2018\u2018prescribe general rules of practice and procedure\u2019\u2019 for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a). In Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress\u2019s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted \u00a72072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that \u2018\u2018really regulates procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\u2019\u2019 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress\u2019s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress\u2019s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court\u2019s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b) provides that the Rules \u2018\u2018shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u2019\u2019 Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, \u00a72072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \u00a72072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and\u2014even if it is\u2014it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the \u2018\u2018modified outcome-determinative test\u2019\u2019 of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the \u2018\u2018Supreme Law of the Land.\u2019\u2019 United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help.

", "Now remember, this is the Closer. Don\u2019t blame me if it\u2019s technical, the rules are technical. My students always confuse crossclaims, counterclaims, and Rule 14 claims. They call one the other, refer to the wrong rule numbers, and get very frustrated. Well, it is confusing, but the best antidote is to simply remember the basic distinctions and apply them systematically. A counterclaim is a claim asserted by a defending party\u2014someone who is on the receiving end of a claim\u2014back against the party who has asserted a claim against him. A crossclaim is a claim asserted against a coparty, that is, a codefendant or coplaintiff on a claim. However, be careful about situations where a party asserts a claim against a coparty (a crossclaim) and the defending party on that crossclaim has a claim back against the claimant. For example, Parker, a codefendant in a case with Spanogle, asserts a claim against Spanogle for contribution, and Spanogle then asserts a claim back against Parker for his own injuries in the accident. In this situation, Spanogle\u2019s claim is a counterclaim. Once Parker asserted a crossclaim against him, he became a \u2018\u2018defending party.\u2019\u2019 Any claim he has against Parker, who asserted the claim against him, is therefore a counterclaim. Once we add Rule 14(a) to the mix, this becomes even more elegant, because Rule 14(a)(3) and (2)(D) allow the plaintiff to assert claims against the third-party defendant and vice versa. For example, if Moretti sues Parker and Spanogle, and Spanogle impleads Adair for contribution, Rule 14(a)(3) allows Moretti, the plaintiff, to assert a claim directly against Adair, the third-party defendant. But this claim is not a counterclaim. Why not? Because a counterclaim is a claim against an opposing party, and, until Moretti asserts a claim against Adair, they are not opposing parties. They are both litigants in the case, but no claim runs between them, until Moretti (or Adair) asserts one. Here\u2019s a stubbornly technical question that asks you to sort all this out. (A diagram is a must here to sort out these complex variations.)  Rule 13, which governs \u2018\u2018counterclaims,\u2019\u2019 allows defending parties to assert claims against parties who bring claims against them. For example, if Lutsky sues Rowe for his injuries in the three-car collision, Rule 13 allows Rowe, the defendant, to assert a claim for his own injuries in the collision against Lutsky. Under Rule 13, a counterclaim is either compulsory or permissive. Rule 13(a) governs compulsory counterclaims: Fed. R. Civ. P. 13. (a) Compulsory counterclaim. (1) In General. A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that \u2014at the time of its service\u2014the pleader has against an opposing party, if the claim: (A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim; and (B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. Rowe\u2019s counterclaim for his injuries in the collision would be compulsory, since it arises from the same accident as Lutsky\u2019s claim against him. Rule 13 (b) allows a defending party (like Rowe) to assert any claims he has against the opposing party that do not arise out of the same events. Between the two, they cover the ground: Any claim that a defending party has against her opponent may be included. But some of them\u2014compulsory counterclaims\u2014must be. This ensures efficiency, since the same issues are likely to arise on the counterclaim, and the same witnesses to be called to testify if the counterclaim is compulsory. And litigating the opposing claims together will avoid inconsistent verdicts on the issues, which could result if the claim and counterclaim are submitted to different juries. However, litigants, like other people, don\u2019t always follow the rules. What will happen if Rowe has a claim against Lutsky, but does not assert it as a counterclaim in Lutsky\u2019s suit? (Consider Rule 13(h) in analyzing this question.)  There are further permutations on the joinder problem. Rule 13(g) authorizes another variation, the crossclaim. A crossclaim is a claim against a coparty, for example, a claim by one defendant against a codefendant, or by one plaintiff against another plaintiff. Crossclaims are authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(g): A pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross- claimant. The basic point is simple: If you\u2019re sued along with another defendant, and you have a claim against the other defendant that arises from the same underlying dispute, you may assert it as a \u2018\u2018crossclaim\u2019\u2019 in the same action. Suppose, for example, that Hammer hires Milsap to build a house for him, and Milsap subcontracts the wiring work to Rosov. The wiring fails, and Hammer sues Milsap, the general contractor, and Rosov, the wiring subcontractor, for damages. Milsap and Rosov are codefendants. Rule 13(g) allows either one to assert claims against the other codefendant arising out of the wiring work. This promotes efficiency in resolving the entire dispute among the parties. It also avoids the potential for inconsistent factual findings, which could happen if claims between Milsap and Rosov arising from this job were litigated separately: If two juries considered the issue of the cause of the failed wiring, one might attribute it to Milsap, and the other to Rosov. Here\u2019s a slightly more complex example building on the Milsap/Rosov hypothetical.  Now let\u2019s tackle Rule 14. Remember that basically, the plaintiff designs her lawsuit. She decides whom she will sue and with whom she will join as co-plaintiffs. The federal rulemakers have generally accepted this premise that the \u2018\u2018plaintiff is master of her claim.\u2019\u2019 But Rule 14 is an exception. It gives defending parties a limited opportunity to bring in a new party to the action, to redesign the suit. But the opportunity really is limited: Under Rule 14(a), a defending party may only bring in a \u2018\u2018third- party defendant\u2019\u2019 in order to pass on all or part of her liability to the party seeking relief from her: Fed. R. Civ. P. 14. Third Party Practice (a) When a Defending Party May Bring in a Third Party. (1) . . . A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it [i.e., to the third-party plaintiff, that is, the original defendant!] for all or part of the claim against it. Under Rule 14(a)(1), a defendant cannot bring in a person who might be liable to the plaintiff only. Nor can she bring in a person who might be liable to her (the defendant) for some related damage that she has suffered. She may only bring in a third-party defendant who may be responsible to reimburse her for part, or all, of the judgment the plaintiff recovers from her. This usually arises in two situations. First, it frequently occurs where a party is liable for an injury but has a right of reimbursement for the damages from another party. For example, a retailer who sold a defective product to a consumer is frequently liable for injuries from the defective product, but can demand indemnification from the manufacturer. If the retailer is sued, it can bring in the manufacturer under Rule 14(a), claiming that the manufacturer is liable to reimburse the retailer for the entire damages awarded against it. Second, Rule 14(a) applies where one defendant has a right to force another party to share in a judgment the plaintiff recovers. Suppose that two drivers cause an accident, and the injured party sues one of the drivers. In many states, that driver, if negligent, would be liable to the injured plaintiff for her full damages, but would have a right to recover \u2018\u2018contribution\u2019\u2019\u2014part of the damages she pays to the plaintiff\u2014from the other driver if the second driver was negligent too. So Driver 1 could implead Driver 2 under Rule 14(a) for contribution. In this common scenario, the primary defendant is trying to recover from the third-party defendant part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the third-party plaintiff [the defendant]. Consider the following example. Recall that supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a) generally allows the court to hear proper Rule 14(a) claims. ", "Now remember, this is the Closer. Don\u2019t blame me if it\u2019s technical, the rules are technical. My students always confuse crossclaims, counterclaims, and Rule 14 claims.

P. 13(g): A pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross- claimant. The basic point is simple: If you\u2019re sued along with another defendant, and you have a claim against the other defendant that arises from the same underlying dispute, you may assert it as a \u2018\u2018crossclaim\u2019\u2019 in the same action. Suppose, for example, that Hammer hires Milsap to build a house for him, and Milsap subcontracts the wiring work to Rosov. The wiring fails, and Hammer sues Milsap, the general contractor, and Rosov, the wiring subcontractor, for damages. Milsap and Rosov are codefendants. Rule 13(g) allows either one to assert claims against the other codefendant arising out of the wiring work. This promotes efficiency in resolving the entire dispute among the parties. It also avoids the potential for inconsistent factual findings, which could happen if claims between Milsap and Rosov arising from this job were litigated separately: If two juries considered the issue of the cause of the failed wiring, one might attribute it to Milsap, and the other to Rosov. Here\u2019s a slightly more complex example building on the Milsap/Rosov hypothetical.  Now let\u2019s tackle Rule 14. Remember that basically, the plaintiff designs her lawsuit. She decides whom she will sue and with whom she will join as co-plaintiffs. The federal rulemakers have generally accepted this premise that the \u2018\u2018plaintiff is master of her claim.\u2019\u2019 But Rule 14 is an exception. It gives defending parties a limited opportunity to bring in a new party to the action, to redesign the suit. But the opportunity really is limited: Under Rule 14(a), a defending party may only bring in a \u2018\u2018third- party defendant\u2019\u2019 in order to pass on all or part of her liability to the party seeking relief from her: Fed. R. Civ. P. 14. Third Party Practice (a) When a Defending Party May Bring in a Third Party. (1) . . . A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it [i.e., to the third-party plaintiff, that is, the original defendant!] for all or part of the claim against it. Under Rule 14(a)(1), a defendant cannot bring in a person who might be liable to the plaintiff only. Nor can she bring in a person who might be liable to her (the defendant) for some related damage that she has suffered. She may only bring in a third-party defendant who may be responsible to reimburse her for part, or all, of the judgment the plaintiff recovers from her. This usually arises in two situations. First, it frequently occurs where a party is liable for an injury but has a right of reimbursement for the damages from another party. For example, a retailer who sold a defective product to a consumer is frequently liable for injuries from the defective product, but can demand indemnification from the manufacturer. If the retailer is sued, it can bring in the manufacturer under Rule 14(a), claiming that the manufacturer is liable to reimburse the retailer for the entire damages awarded against it. Second, Rule 14(a) applies where one defendant has a right to force another party to share in a judgment the plaintiff recovers. Suppose that two drivers cause an accident, and the injured party sues one of the drivers. In many states, that driver, if negligent, would be liable to the injured plaintiff for her full damages, but would have a right to recover \u2018\u2018contribution\u2019\u2019\u2014part of the damages she pays to the plaintiff\u2014from the other driver if the second driver was negligent too. So Driver 1 could implead Driver 2 under Rule 14(a) for contribution. In this common scenario, the primary defendant is trying to recover from the third-party defendant part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the third-party plaintiff [the defendant]. Consider the following example. Recall that supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a) generally allows the court to hear proper Rule 14(a) claims. ", "Now remember, this is the Closer. Don\u2019t blame me if it\u2019s technical, the rules are technical. My students always confuse crossclaims, counterclaims, and Rule 14 claims. They call one the other, refer to the wrong rule numbers, and get very frustrated. Well, it is confusing, but the best antidote is to simply remember the basic distinctions and apply them systematically. A counterclaim is a claim asserted by a defending party\u2014someone who is on the receiving end of a claim\u2014back against the party who has asserted a claim against him. A crossclaim is a claim asserted against a coparty, that is, a codefendant or coplaintiff on a claim. However, be careful about situations where a party asserts a claim against a coparty (a crossclaim) and the defending party on that crossclaim has a claim back against the claimant. For example, Parker, a codefendant in a case with Spanogle, asserts a claim against Spanogle for contribution, and Spanogle then asserts a claim back against Parker for his own injuries in the accident. In this situation, Spanogle\u2019s claim is a counterclaim. Once Parker asserted a crossclaim against him, he became a \u2018\u2018defending party.\u2019\u2019 Any claim he has against Parker, who asserted the claim against him, is therefore a counterclaim. Once we add Rule 14(a) to the mix, this becomes even more elegant, because Rule 14(a)(3) and (2)(D) allow the plaintiff to assert claims against the third-party defendant and vice versa. For example, if Moretti sues Parker and Spanogle, and Spanogle impleads Adair for contribution, Rule 14(a)(3) allows Moretti, the plaintiff, to assert a claim directly against Adair, the third-party defendant. But this claim is not a counterclaim. Why not? Because a counterclaim is a claim against an opposing party, and, until Moretti asserts a claim against Adair, they are not opposing parties. They are both litigants in the case, but no claim runs between them, until Moretti (or Adair) asserts one. Here\u2019s a stubbornly technical question that asks you to sort all this out. (A diagram is a must here to sort out these complex variations.)  Rule 13, which governs \u2018\u2018counterclaims,\u2019\u2019 allows defending parties to assert claims against parties who bring claims against them. For example, if Lutsky sues Rowe for his injuries in the three-car collision, Rule 13 allows Rowe, the defendant, to assert a claim for his own injuries in the collision against Lutsky. Under Rule 13, a counterclaim is either compulsory or permissive. Rule 13(a) governs compulsory counterclaims: Fed. R. Civ. P. 13. (a) Compulsory counterclaim. (1) In General. A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that \u2014at the time of its service\u2014the pleader has against an opposing party, if the claim: (A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim; and (B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. Rowe\u2019s counterclaim for his injuries in the collision would be compulsory, since it arises from the same accident as Lutsky\u2019s claim against him. Rule 13 (b) allows a defending party (like Rowe) to assert any claims he has against the opposing party that do not arise out of the same events. Between the two, they cover the ground: Any claim that a defending party has against her opponent may be included. But some of them\u2014compulsory counterclaims\u2014must be. This ensures efficiency, since the same issues are likely to arise on the counterclaim, and the same witnesses to be called to testify if the counterclaim is compulsory. And litigating the opposing claims together will avoid inconsistent verdicts on the issues, which could result if the claim and counterclaim are submitted to different juries. However, litigants, like other people, don\u2019t always follow the rules. What will happen if Rowe has a claim against Lutsky, but does not assert it as a counterclaim in Lutsky\u2019s suit? (Consider Rule 13(h) in analyzing this question.)  There are further permutations on the joinder problem. Rule 13(g) authorizes another variation, the crossclaim.

In analyzing the problem, focus ruthlessly on the language of the statute.", "As we saw in the first part of this chapter, the Federal Rules allow the plaintiff to present as many claims as she has evidence to support, even if they can\u2019t all be true. The idea is to put the defendant on notice of the positions that you may seek to establish, not a single one you have settled on irrevocably. The same goes for the defendant. Under Rule 8, the defendant is allowed to plead whatever defenses she has to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. She may take inconsistent positions about the facts or the law, and may raise multiple defenses without choosing among them. The defendant might, for example, deny that she was negligent, but also allege that the plaintiff was more negligent than she was and is therefore barred from recovery. She might deny that she had a contract with the plaintiff, raise as a second defense that she did not breach, and raise as a third defense that the statute of limitations bars recovery. Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn\u2019t required to stake her case on one of them. Although Rule 11(b)(3) requires support for affirmative defenses as well as factual allegations in the original complaint, it is unfortunately common for defendants to \u2018\u2018overplead\u2019\u2019 affirmative defenses. Given the short period for filing an answer, and the potential for malpractice exposure for failing to raise a defense, many answers include a long list of \u2018\u2018boilerplate\u2019\u2019 defenses, many clearly irrelevant to the case. Doubtless, counsel view the risk of sanctions for overpleading defenses as less grievous than the risk of waiving a defense by failing to assert it. The unfortunate side effect of this, however, is that such answers do not fully serve the purpose the rule-makers envisioned: to reveal the parties\u2019 real positions and to narrow the scope of controverted issues. Here\u2019s a question that explores the defendant\u2019s options.  Rule 8 contains simple, sensible provisions governing the defendant\u2019s responses to the allegations in the complaint. First, Rule 8(b) requires the defendant to admit or deny each of the allegations in the complaint. Usually, this is done paragraph by paragraph. Rule 10(b) requires that averments in the complaint be set forth in separate paragraphs. The defendant, in answering, must take a position on each of these allegations, by admitting those that are true, and denying those that aren\u2019t. Under Rule 8(b)(2), a \u2018\u2018denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.\u2019\u2019 If the defendant means to deny only a part of an allegation, she must specify what is true and deny only the parts that are not. Failing to deny an allegation constitutes an admission of it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6). The idea is that, if the parties plead conscientiously by the Rules, the parties and the court can compare the allegations in the complaint and the responses in the answer, and determine which issues are contested and which are agreed upon (and therefore need not be litigated). If all goes right, this simple pleading process can narrow the scope of the dispute considerably. The Rule also recognizes that the defendant may not know whether some allegations in the complaint are true or not. If she has grounds to deny them, she may do so, but if she just doesn\u2019t know, or doesn\u2019t have the information necessary to admit or deny at the time of pleading, she may respond that she \u2018\u2018lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation.\u2019\u2019 Fed.

Under Rule 8, the defendant is allowed to plead whatever defenses she has to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. She may take inconsistent positions about the facts or the law, and may raise multiple defenses without choosing among them.

Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn\u2019t required to stake her case on one of them.

", "While the pleadings are meant to define the scope of the issues litigated at trial, in practice it is not unusual for parties to litigate issues, both in discovery and at trial, that were never pleaded. For example, in a breach of contract case, Smith might try to develop evidence that, if the contract was not enforceable, the defendant had been unjustly enriched, so that Smith should recover in quantum meruit. Even though Smith hadn\u2019t pleaded quantum meruit, the course of the parties\u2019 discovery, the manner in which they presented their evidence at trial, their cross-examination of the other side\u2019s witnesses, and their requests for jury instructions might make it clear that they were actually trying the case on both contract and quantum meruit theories. If so, the fact that the quantum meruit claim was never added to the complaint should not prevent consideration of a quantum meruit claim. Similarly, the depositions and cross-examination in a negligence case might show that the defendant relied on the plaintiff\u2019s negligence as a defense (or a partial defense, in a comparative negligence jurisdiction), and that the plaintiff had tried to controvert the defense. Even if the defendant\u2019s answer to the complaint did not raise comparative negligence as a defense, it might be evident to everyone that the parties were litigating that issue. Where this is the case, Rule 15(b) provides that the court may acknowledge the reality that the parties have litigated the issue by allowing an amendment to formally place that issue in contention.

(b) Amendments During and After Trial. (1) Based on an Objection at Trial. If at a trial, a party objects that evidence is not within the issues raised in the pleadings, the court may permit the pleadings to be amended. The court should freely permit an amendment when doing so will aid in presenting the merits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the evidence would prejudice that party\u2019s action or defense on the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence. This subsection addresses the situation in which evidence is offered at trial to establish a claim or defense that is not in the pleadings. The rule permits the judge, if the parties have consciously been litigating the issue to which the offered evidence is relevant, to allow an amendment to the pleadings\u2014at the trial itself\u2014to expressly assert the claim or defense the evidence supports. Of course, if the judge concludes that the objecting party really did not understand that the issue was being litigated, the judge may exclude the evidence and deny an amendment raising the new issue (or allow the amendment and grant a continuance for the objecting party to prepare to litigate the new issue). Rule 15(b)(2) addresses the similar situation in which the parties actually try an issue that is not in the pleadings. If the parties have treated the issue as actually in dispute (such as the plaintiff\u2019s comparative negligence), and presented their evidence on the point, and the jury is instructed on it and decides the issue, Rule 15(b)(2) confirms that the issue is properly tried, even though it was not in the initial pleadings and no amendment raising it was sought during the trial. In either case, the thrust of the rule is to make the pleadings reflect the issues that the parties are really litigating, rather than forcing the parties to litigate only the issues originally pleaded. As with Rule 15(a), the goal is to allow the parties every opportunity, consistent with fair notice to the other side, to try the issues as they are understood by the partner at trial, not as they were initially framed. That does not mean that parties will always convince a judge to hold that issues that were not pleaded are fairly in contention at trial. The key is fairness, and fairness requires notice to the opposing party. Where parties clearly understand that issues are in contention, and are prepared to meet them, the court will allow amendments to the pleadings to confirm that those issues are in the case (or simply act as though they were pleaded without requiring a formal amendment).

The court should freely permit an amendment when doing so will aid in presenting the merits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the evidence would prejudice that party\u2019s action or defense on the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence. This subsection addresses the situation in which evidence is offered at trial to establish a claim or defense that is not in the pleadings. The rule permits the judge, if the parties have consciously been litigating the issue to which the offered evidence is relevant, to allow an amendment to the pleadings\u2014at the trial itself\u2014to expressly assert the claim or defense the evidence supports. Of course, if the judge concludes that the objecting party really did not understand that the issue was being litigated, the judge may exclude the evidence and deny an amendment raising the new issue (or allow the amendment and grant a continuance for the objecting party to prepare to litigate the new issue). Rule 15(b)(2) addresses the similar situation in which the parties actually try an issue that is not in the pleadings. If the parties have treated the issue as actually in dispute (such as the plaintiff\u2019s comparative negligence), and presented their evidence on the point, and the jury is instructed on it and decides the issue, Rule 15(b)(2) confirms that the issue is properly tried, even though it was not in the initial pleadings and no amendment raising it was sought during the trial. In either case, the thrust of the rule is to make the pleadings reflect the issues that the parties are really litigating, rather than forcing the parties to litigate only the issues originally pleaded. As with Rule 15(a), the goal is to allow the parties every opportunity, consistent with fair notice to the other side, to try the issues as they are understood by the partner at trial, not as they were initially framed. That does not mean that parties will always convince a judge to hold that issues that were not pleaded are fairly in contention at trial. The key is fairness, and fairness requires notice to the opposing party. Where parties clearly understand that issues are in contention, and are prepared to meet them, the court will allow amendments to the pleadings to confirm that those issues are in the case (or simply act as though they were pleaded without requiring a formal amendment). However, Rule 15(b) does not allow a party to inject a new issue into the case at trial that was not \u2018\u2018tried by the parties\u2019 express or implied consent.\u2019\u2019 Sometimes, of course, it can be a subtle question whether the parties were consciously litigating an issue, especially where evidence produced at trial is relevant to more than one claim or defense. Here\u2019s a tough question to illustrate the application of Rule 15(b).", "There\u2019s a lot more to Rule 11 than we have covered so far. Let\u2019s round out the discussion with a Closer that\u2014if you want to nail it\u2014will force you do something many of my students resist to the teeth\u2014to actually read the rule. The answers to this Closer are all tucked in there somewhere. Think of it as a litigator\u2019s treasure hunt.  The previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments. They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important question: What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).)  Consider the dilemma for the drafters of Rule 11 when establishing ethical limits on asserting legal positions before the court. Surely, they don\u2019t want to prevent lawyers from arguing for legal positions that have not been recognized before. Then the law could never change, because lawyers would be subject to sanctions for arguing for change. Surely, the rule makers also would not want to bar lawyers from arguing for the overruling of established law, for the same reason. But they do want to rein in extravagant or outlandish legal arguments that waste the courts\u2019 time. Rule 11(b) walks this line by requiring that there be a \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous argument\u2019\u2019 for legal positions that are not currently recognized or would require the court to overrule current law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), an advocate certifies to the court that the legal positions taken in a pleading, motion or other paper are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), the party asserting a legal position must have a rational argument for the position asserted, a position that has not been definitively rejected by the courts of the jurisdiction so recently that nothing but obstinacy would lead a lawyer to try again. Such \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous\u2019\u2019 arguments might be based on precedents from other states, dissenting opinions, changes by the appellate courts of the relevant state in related areas of law, scholarly criticism of the current law, or other authority suggesting that change is warranted. If you are going to file a pleading, motion, or other paper that argues for a change in the law, but don\u2019t want to risk Rule 11 sanctions, think of it this way: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going out on a limb here. My position is contradicted by the cases. If the judge calls me in before the bench and asks why I should not be sanctioned for violating Rule 11(b)(2), what will I say?\u2019\u2019 You need to be ready with a credible explanation why your argument for change is justified by precedent or other authority. You might say, \u2018\u2018Yes, your honor, I know that I\u2019m arguing to overrule Flores v. Jones, the case on point from our state supreme court, but the Third Restatement of Torts now takes the position I advocate, and four states have recently adopted it.\u2019\u2019 Or, \u2018\u2018Yes, your Honor, I know our state supreme court ruled otherwise in 1934, but look at how many areas of tort law they have modified since. Recognizing this cause of action is supported by our court\u2019s consistent expansion of tort remedies for negligence, reflected in the following seven cases.\u2019\u2019 Arguments like those are \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous.\u2019\u2019 The advocate is not just saying, \u2018\u2018I think the law should be otherwise,\u2019\u2019 but pointing to legal authority that supports the argument. This is reasoned persuasive argument rather than stubborn refusal to face the music. Courts should not prevent that, and Rule 11(b) (2) does not either. Consider this question on the point.  Rule 11 also imposes constraints on the factual allegations made in a pleading or motion. Under Rule 11(b)(3), the party making factual allegations certifies that \u2018\u2018after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,\u2019\u2019 those allegations \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\u2019\u2019 The basic standard, that the factual contentions \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support,\u2019\u2019 mandates that counsel have looked into the facts and have credible evidence in support of each fact alleged in her court filings. This standard clearly does not require that the evidence available at the time of filing the paper clearly establishes the fact alleged, or even makes it more probable than not that the fact is true. It requires that counsel have looked into the matter, and after doing so has some preliminary evidence in support of the allegation. That\u2019s a pretty indulgent standard, yet it does bar the tempting practice of filing papers without evidence and then casting about to find some later down the line. That is a temptation to busy counsel that Rule 11(b)(3) is meant to discourage. Consider this example. To nail it, take a look at Rule 11(c)(1) as well as Rule 11(b).

She could, for example, move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to join an indispensable party. If she raised those two objections in a jurisdiction that adheres to the older special appearance approach, she would be deemed to waive her objection to personal jurisdiction by also raising an issue that is presumably only relevant if the court has jurisdiction.

A defendant who claimed that the court in which suit was filed lacked jurisdiction over her would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 to contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The defendant making a special appearance had to do so before answering the complaint on the merits, and she had to confine her argument to the lack of jurisdiction. If she raised any other issue, the court would hold that she had entered a \u2018\u2018general appearance\u2019\u2019 by litigating issues other than jurisdiction. Any reference to the merits, or even to other types of preliminary objections, could lead the court to conclude that, by appearing to litigate other issues, the defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and waived her objection to personal jurisdiction. In the federal courts, and in the many states that have modeled their procedural rules after the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, objections to personal jurisdiction are governed by Rule 12. The common law special appearance does not apply. But Rule 12 bears some resemblance to its common law ancestor. It still requires that the objection be asserted in the first response to the complaint, either a pre-answer motion or answer. And it still provides that the objection is waived if it isn\u2019t raised in a timely manner. The major difference, however, is that a defendant who moves to dismiss in federal court under Rule 12 for lack of jurisdiction may, in the same motion, assert other pre-answer defenses. She could, for example, move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to join an indispensable party. If she raised those two objections in a jurisdiction that adheres to the older special appearance approach, she would be deemed to waive her objection to personal jurisdiction by also raising an issue that is presumably only relevant if the court has jurisdiction. Here are two examples to help sort these matters out. They both involve cases removed to federal court. Keep in mind that in a removed case, state procedure applies until removal. Federal procedure applies once the case has been removed to federal court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 81(c)(1).", "My students perennially confuse the special appearance with the objection to personal jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). That\u2019s understandable. In studying personal jurisdiction, we read common law cases in which the defendant \u2018\u2018appears specially\u2019\u2019 to object to jurisdiction.

Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General.

In the following question, consider whether the information sought is relevant to the claims and defenses of the parties.    ", "If a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement? Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This \u2018\u2018aggregation\u2019\u2019 problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot \u2018\u2018aggregate\u2019\u2019 claims against different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a \u2018\u2018common, undivided interest.\u2019\u2019 (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at Chapter 14, pp. 279-283. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.  Frequently, a plaintiff sues two or more defendants on a tort claim for injuries arguably worth more than $75,000. Suppose, for example, that Epstein suffers nerve damage during surgery, and that the damages are $90,000. He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith\u2019s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe\u2019s fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe \u2018\u2018jointly and severally liable\u2019\u2019 for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence. But the amount requirement would be met in either type of jurisdiction. As long as either defendant might be held liable for the full $90,000, that amount is \u2018\u2018in controversy\u2019\u2019 between her and the plaintiff. Since either Smith or Doe might be found solely at fault, either might be held liable for the full $90,000.

If a party is living in a state without definite plans to leave, the domicile test regards that state as her \u2018\u2018home.\u2019\u2019 She is there, not as a visitor, but as a citizen. She is, psychologically speaking, at home there, rather than passing through. She may choose to move on, as we all may, but at the moment she has no plans to do so. Remember that, until the two prongs coincide in a new state, your old domicile continues, whether you plan to return to that state or not.

", "A deposition is the examination of a witness under oath. Depositions are the most effective means of previewing the detailed testimony of witnesses. The party wishing to depose the witness sends a notice of the deposition to the deponent and to all other parties. If the deponent is not a party, a subpoena must also be sent to ensure the witness\u2019s attendance. The subpoena is a court order to appear and give testimony. A witness who ignores it may be punished by the court. (Parties do not have to be subpoenaed, because they are already before the court and subject to the rules of discovery and to court orders enforcing them.) Depositions serve several purposes. They \u2018\u2018get the witness on the record.\u2019\u2019 That is, the witness tells her story under oath. If she contradicts that story at trial, she can be impeached with her deposition testimony. Depositions also allow deposing counsel to learn what the witness knows and to ask follow-up questions to get the details of what the witness knows. In addition, taking a witness\u2019s deposition gives opposing counsel the opportunity to look the witness in the eye, to form a judgment about her credibility and about how she will likely perform as a witness at trial. Ordinarily, parties will depose the other side\u2019s witnesses rather than their own. After all, they can talk to their own witnesses privately, without revealing the witness\u2019s testimony or counsel\u2019s line of reasoning by the questions they ask. For the same reason, counsel do not usually cross-examine in detail at a deposition, except to clarify points on which the deponent\u2019s testimony may create a misimpression. However, in some cases a party may depose a witness in order to obtain the party\u2019s testimony for use at trial. If, for example, a witness is moving out of the country, the party who wants to use that witness\u2019s testimony at trial may take her deposition as a substitute for her live testimony at the trial. The deposition will be admissible at trial if the witness is not available to testify in person. Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(4). Note that in this scenario, unlike the typical deposition, the party noticing the deposition will be the party who plans to use that witness\u2019s testimony, not the opposing party. Consider what the plaintiff\u2019s counsel should do in the following scenario.", "While depositions produce sworn testimony, they are not taken in front of a judge. They are usually taken in the office of the lawyer taking the deposition. A court reporter, hired privately by deposing counsel, swears the witness and records the testimony. The testimony is then transcribed and provided to counsel for each party. Counsel for all parties are entitled to attend the deposition, and usually do. An interesting problem arises if the deponent\u2019s lawyer has objections to the deposing counsel\u2019s questions. Since there\u2019s no judge present to rule on objections, what happens? Several provisions of Rule 30 address this problem. Rule 30(c)(2) provides: An objection at the time of the examination\u2014whether to evidence, to a party\u2019s conduct, to the officer\u2019s qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition\u2014must be noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection. That rule further provides that \u2018\u2018A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d) (3).\u2019\u2019 Rule 30(d)(3)(A) authorizes a party to seek a protective order from the court if the deposition is being conducted \u2018\u2018in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party.\u2019\u2019 Under these provisions, the deponent\u2019s counsel may raise objections to the questions asked, but the deponent must usually answer despite the objection. For example, if the witness is asked a question her counsel considers irrelevant to the issues in the case, her counsel may object, but the witness should still answer the question (\u2018\u2018the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection\u2019\u2019\u2014Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c)(2)). This approach generally makes sense: most objections are meant to protect against the use of evidence at trial, not against providing the testimony per se. Since most deposition testimony is never used at trial, most of the objections raised to the testimony will never have to be resolved. If the disputed deposition testimony is offered at trial, the judge can rule on the objections when it is offered in evidence. So, the questioning at the deposition is fairly unconstrained.

The same issue then arises again in a later suit between Smith and Doe, and Doe invokes collateral estoppel to bar Smith from relitigating it. This is a case of \u2018\u2018mutual collateral estoppel,\u2019\u2019 because Doe, the party invoking estoppel in the second action was a party to the first, litigated it against Smith in that action, and prevailed on the issue in Suit One. However, an issue previously litigated and decided may arise in later litigation involving a new party as well. Suppose, for example, that Forrestal Corporation sues Quantum Software for infringing its patent, and loses because the jury finds that the patent is invalid. Subsequently, Forrestal sues Apex Corporation for infringing on the patent. Apex would like to invoke collateral estoppel, arguing that Forrestal litigated and lost on the patent issue in Suit One and should not be able to relitigate the issue. Under traditional principles of collateral estoppel, Apex could not invoke estoppel, because it was not a party to the first suit. Under the \u2018\u2018mutuality\u2019\u2019 doctrine, which still reigns in some jurisdictions, only the parties to the first action could invoke estoppel based on findings in that action. Apex, a stranger to Suit One, could not step in and use the finding from that suit to bar Forrestal from relitigating the validity issue. Other courts have moved away from mutuality, recognizing that, under some conditions, allowing a new party to invoke estoppel is fair. The key case on the point is Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979), in which the Supreme Court cautiously authorized federal trial judges to apply non-mutual estoppel in circumstances that ensure that the issue was fairly decided in the first action.

Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979), in which the Supreme Court cautiously authorized federal trial judges to apply non-mutual estoppel in circumstances that ensure that the issue was fairly decided in the first action. However, while the federal courts and a good many state courts now allow non-mutual estoppel, all courts adhere to a fundamental requirement: that the party who is being estopped must have litigated and lost on the issue in the prior suit. The party invoking estoppel may be new, but the party who is barred from relitigating must have had its fair bite at the apple in the first suit. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to invoke estoppel to bar her from litigating the issue. In analyzing a non-mutual preclusion problem, start by asking who litigated the issues in the prior action. In a mutuality jurisdiction, only those parties may use estoppel in a later action. In a non-mutuality jurisdiction, estoppel can be used against a party who litigated and lost on an issue in the first suit. Here\u2019s a case that makes the point.", "The cases we\u2019ve analyzed so far have involved situations in which one of the parties to Suit One invokes collateral estoppel in a later action between the same parties. Suppose, for example, that Smith sues Doe, and loses on Issue A. The same issue then arises again in a later suit between Smith and Doe, and Doe invokes collateral estoppel to bar Smith from relitigating it. This is a case of \u2018\u2018mutual collateral estoppel,\u2019\u2019 because Doe, the party invoking estoppel in the second action was a party to the first, litigated it against Smith in that action, and prevailed on the issue in Suit One. However, an issue previously litigated and decided may arise in later litigation involving a new party as well. Suppose, for example, that Forrestal Corporation sues Quantum Software for infringing its patent, and loses because the jury finds that the patent is invalid. Subsequently, Forrestal sues Apex Corporation for infringing on the patent. Apex would like to invoke collateral estoppel, arguing that Forrestal litigated and lost on the patent issue in Suit One and should not be able to relitigate the issue. Under traditional principles of collateral estoppel, Apex could not invoke estoppel, because it was not a party to the first suit. Under the \u2018\u2018mutuality\u2019\u2019 doctrine, which still reigns in some jurisdictions, only the parties to the first action could invoke estoppel based on findings in that action.

Here\u2019s a case that makes the point.", "The preceding sections make clear that state courts are going to decide many questions of federal law. First, they will decide such questions when plaintiffs file cases arising under federal law in state court, if the defendant doesn\u2019t remove to federal court. Second, they will decide federal questions when the plaintiff sues in state court on state law claims, and the defendant relies on federal law as a defense, as the defendant did in Mottley. And third, they will decide federal issues when the plaintiff sues in state court and the defendant asserts a counterclaim arising under federal law. In all these situations, the courts of the fifty states will be deciding issues of federal law. Naturally, different courts in different states may decide the same issue differently. One state may decide that a claimant must show intent to discriminate under the ADEA, while another may interpret it to bar practices that have a disparate impact on older employees, even if no intent is shown. Suppose one state court holds that the federal statute in Mottley bars renewal of passes, but the courts of another state hold that it doesn\u2019t? There has to be some court at the top of the system to reconcile such conflicting holdings, to rule definitively on the meaning of federal law. And that court ought to be a federal court: otherwise the states could undermine federal authority by unsympathetic interpretation or application of federal law. Under our constitutional system, the obvious candidate for this role is the United States Supreme Court. And, under Osborn, the Court itself has held that it has the authority to fulfill that role, even in cases involving federal defenses or counterclaims, since federal law is \u2018\u2018an ingredient\u2019\u2019 in such cases. But, of course, it would be severely hampered in fulfilling that role if its power to exercise judicial review were limited by the Mottley rule, if it could only review cases in which the plaintiff asserts a claim arising under federal law. However, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, to which the Mottley rule applies, does not address the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court. It addresses the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts, the trial courts of the federal system. The statute that governs the Supreme Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71257, is a great deal broader than \u00a71331. 28 U.S.C. \u00a71257. State courts; certiorari (a) Final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari where the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in question or where the validity of a statute of any State is drawn in question on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, or where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution or the treaties or statutes of, or any commission held or authority exercised under, the United States. This statute authorizes the Supreme Court to review cases that come up to it through the court systems of the states. It allows review of cases in which federal issues are raised\u2014by defendants as well as plaintiffs. Suppose, for example, that a town sued a defendant for violating a state adult bookstore zoning statute, and the store owner claimed the statute was unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. This case could not be brought in federal court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, as interpreted in Mottley, since it arises under a state zoning statute. But the state court\u2019s decision upholding or invalidating the statute could be reviewed by the Supreme Court under \u00a71257, since it involves a claim (by the defendant) that the state statute is \u2018\u2018repugnant to the Constitution.\u2019\u2019 Consider this example, which analyzes the scope of review in the United States Supreme Court of state court cases posing federal issues.  Thus, with arising-under cases as with diversity cases, it is always necessary to analyze the constitutional scope of jurisdiction and Congress\u2019s grant of that jurisdiction separately. In arising-under cases, as in diversity cases, Congress has never chosen to authorize the federal district courts to exercise all of the Article III jurisdiction. Here\u2019s another example to drive home the point.  Article III, \u00a72 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases \u2018\u2018arising under\u2019\u2019 federal law. And 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, the statute conveying arising-under jurisdiction to the federal district courts, uses the same language. A student, or a lawyer, might reasonably conclude that this language means the same thing in the statute and in the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase \u2018\u2018arising under federal law\u2019\u2019 in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, shouldn\u2019t that phrase mean the same thing in Article III, \u00a72? Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. If the Mottley rule were an interpretation of Article III, it would drastically restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases that involve federal defenses and counterclaims. For example, the Court would have no power to hear an appeal in a case like Consolidated\u2019s in Question 1, which raises a federal issue, but does not satisfy the Mottley test. The state courts would then have the final authority to decide the federal law questions raised by the case. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of the Article III arising-under jurisdiction much more broadly than Mottley\u2019s construction of the arising-under statute. In Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. 738 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of the case. Certainly, federal law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of a case if a federal issue is raised as a defense or as a counterclaim. Thus, because the Article III grant extends to such cases, Congress could do away with the Mottley rule (what law student would miss it?) by amending 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. Although this has been clear since Osborn, Congress has never repudiated Mottley, because it provides a clear rule that allows federal courts to determine their jurisdiction at the outset of the case, and limits the potential for parties to manipulate federal jurisdiction. To illustrate the distinction between the reach of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III and under \u00a71331, consider the following question.    ", "The preceding sections make clear that state courts are going to decide many questions of federal law.

The state courts would then have the final authority to decide the federal law questions raised by the case. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of the Article III arising-under jurisdiction much more broadly than Mottley\u2019s construction of the arising-under statute. In Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. 738 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of the case. Certainly, federal law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of a case if a federal issue is raised as a defense or as a counterclaim. Thus, because the Article III grant extends to such cases, Congress could do away with the Mottley rule (what law student would miss it?) by amending 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. Although this has been clear since Osborn, Congress has never repudiated Mottley, because it provides a clear rule that allows federal courts to determine their jurisdiction at the outset of the case, and limits the potential for parties to manipulate federal jurisdiction. To illustrate the distinction between the reach of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III and under \u00a71331, consider the following question.    ", "The preceding sections make clear that state courts are going to decide many questions of federal law. First, they will decide such questions when plaintiffs file cases arising under federal law in state court, if the defendant doesn\u2019t remove to federal court. Second, they will decide federal questions when the plaintiff sues in state court on state law claims, and the defendant relies on federal law as a defense, as the defendant did in Mottley. And third, they will decide federal issues when the plaintiff sues in state court and the defendant asserts a counterclaim arising under federal law. In all these situations, the courts of the fifty states will be deciding issues of federal law. Naturally, different courts in different states may decide the same issue differently. One state may decide that a claimant must show intent to discriminate under the ADEA, while another may interpret it to bar practices that have a disparate impact on older employees, even if no intent is shown. Suppose one state court holds that the federal statute in Mottley bars renewal of passes, but the courts of another state hold that it doesn\u2019t? There has to be some court at the top of the system to reconcile such conflicting holdings, to rule definitively on the meaning of federal law. And that court ought to be a federal court: otherwise the states could undermine federal authority by unsympathetic interpretation or application of federal law. Under our constitutional system, the obvious candidate for this role is the United States Supreme Court. And, under Osborn, the Court itself has held that it has the authority to fulfill that role, even in cases involving federal defenses or counterclaims, since federal law is \u2018\u2018an ingredient\u2019\u2019 in such cases. But, of course, it would be severely hampered in fulfilling that role if its power to exercise judicial review were limited by the Mottley rule, if it could only review cases in which the plaintiff asserts a claim arising under federal law. However, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, to which the Mottley rule applies, does not address the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court. It addresses the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts, the trial courts of the federal system. The statute that governs the Supreme Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71257, is a great deal broader than \u00a71331. 28 U.S.C. \u00a71257. State courts; certiorari (a) Final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari where the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in question or where the validity of a statute of any State is drawn in question on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, or where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution or the treaties or statutes of, or any commission held or authority exercised under, the United States. This statute authorizes the Supreme Court to review cases that come up to it through the court systems of the states. It allows review of cases in which federal issues are raised\u2014by defendants as well as plaintiffs. Suppose, for example, that a town sued a defendant for violating a state adult bookstore zoning statute, and the store owner claimed the statute was unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. This case could not be brought in federal court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, as interpreted in Mottley, since it arises under a state zoning statute. But the state court\u2019s decision upholding or invalidating the statute could be reviewed by the Supreme Court under \u00a71257, since it involves a claim (by the defendant) that the state statute is \u2018\u2018repugnant to the Constitution.\u2019\u2019 Consider this example, which analyzes the scope of review in the United States Supreme Court of state court cases posing federal issues.  Thus, with arising-under cases as with diversity cases, it is always necessary to analyze the constitutional scope of jurisdiction and Congress\u2019s grant of that jurisdiction separately. In arising-under cases, as in diversity cases, Congress has never chosen to authorize the federal district courts to exercise all of the Article III jurisdiction. Here\u2019s another example to drive home the point.  Article III, \u00a72 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases \u2018\u2018arising under\u2019\u2019 federal law. And 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, the statute conveying arising-under jurisdiction to the federal district courts, uses the same language. A student, or a lawyer, might reasonably conclude that this language means the same thing in the statute and in the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase \u2018\u2018arising under federal law\u2019\u2019 in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, shouldn\u2019t that phrase mean the same thing in Article III, \u00a72? Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. If the Mottley rule were an interpretation of Article III, it would drastically restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases that involve federal defenses and counterclaims. For example, the Court would have no power to hear an appeal in a case like Consolidated\u2019s in Question 1, which raises a federal issue, but does not satisfy the Mottley test. The state courts would then have the final authority to decide the federal law questions raised by the case. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of the Article III arising-under jurisdiction much more broadly than Mottley\u2019s construction of the arising-under statute.

To illustrate the distinction between the reach of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III and under \u00a71331, consider the following question.    ", "The removal statute provides that \u2018\u2018all defendants who have been properly joined and served as defendants must join in or consent to the removal.\u2019\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a71446(b)(2)(a). If Akila sues Redstone and Cianci in state court on a federal claim, and Redstone wants to be in federal court, but Cianci doesn\u2019t, the case cannot be removed. Well, that\u2019s not quite true. Redstone could file a notice of removal, but if Cianci wants the state forum, he would then move to remand to the state court on the ground that he did not agree to removal. And that motion would be granted. If the defendants don\u2019t agree to federal court, the case will stay in state court. If a case is removable, it must be removed within thirty days. 28 U.S.C. \u00a71446(a). But there\u2019s another thirty-day rule in the removal statutes, and it\u2019s trickier than the first. Section 1447(c) provides in part: \u2018\u2018A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a).\u2019\u2019 This section requires that, if any party has an objection to removal, other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction, she must raise it within thirty days after removal, or the objection is waived. For example, if the plaintiff claimed the case wasn\u2019t removed within thirty days, she could seek remand on this ground, but only within thirty days after removal. The rationale for this short window for most motions to remand is the same as the rationale for the first thirty-day period for removing the case: Both courts need to know where the case is going to be litigated. The section seeks to avoid belated procedural objections from disgruntled litigants that would disrupt the litigation. This question illustrates the operation of \u00a71447(c)\u2019s waiver provision.", "Here\u2019s a challenging Closer that involves removal under \u00a71441(a), supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a), and the \u00a71441(b)(2) limit on removal of diversity cases. Good luck!  The basic standard for removal jurisdiction is simple and sensible: a defendant sued in state court may remove a case to federal court if it could have been filed originally in federal court. The rationale for removal is to give both parties access to federal court for cases within the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction. So it makes sense that the standard for removing a case to federal court should mirror the standard for filing one in federal court to begin with. So, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71441(a) provides that \u2018\u2018any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 may be removed to federal court. Consequently, the first question to ask in analyzing a removal problem is whether the claim asserted by the plaintiff fits into some category of federal jurisdiction. Is it a diversity case, or an arising-under case? A case between a citizen and foreign citizen, or some other case provided for in Article III, \u00a72? If not, it can\u2019t be removed. If it is, then, with a few minor exceptions, it can be. Here\u2019s a first example to illustrate this relation between original and removal jurisdiction.  While it is generally true that a case that could have been filed in federal court can be removed there, it is not always true. The removal statute provides that a diversity case cannot be removed if there is an in-state defendant: \u00a71441(b)(2).

This is a sensible limit on removal, given the rationale for federal diversity jurisdiction. The logic for allowing diversity cases to be brought in federal court is the risk of prejudice in the state court; but if a defendant is sued in her home state, she is not at risk of prejudice. If Coretta, from Wisconsin, sues Parkins, from Iowa, in an Iowa state court, there is little reason to allow Parkins to remove. Any prejudice in the state court would be in favor of Parkins, so why allow her to bump the case into federal court? Section 1441 (b)(2) therefore bars her from doing so. Consider this illustration.

This case doesn\u2019t belong here; throw it out.\u2019\u2019 All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court\u2019s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019 The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have \u2018\u2018appeared generally,\u2019\u2019 waiving her special appearance and accepting the court\u2019s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \u2018\u2018special appearance\u2019\u2019 had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\u2019s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\u2019s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here\u2019s a question to test the point. I\u2019ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you\u2019ve read the discussion above it should be easy.  A defendant sued away from home has another option if she believes that the court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. She may ignore the suit entirely. Suppose that Ito, sued by Ervin in Emporia, never moves to dismiss, never appears specially, simply ignores the law suit. What will happen? The court will very likely assume that Ito has no defense to the claim, and enter a default judgment for Ervin on the claim. But who cares? If Ito has no property in Emporia, and no plans to go there personally, Ervin won\u2019t be able to collect the judgment there. He will have to come to Ito\u2019s state to enforce the judgment. This is often done by bringing an action for a \u2018\u2018judgment on the judgment\u2019\u2019 in the enforcing state, to convert the Emporia judgment into a judgment of the enforcing state. Once Ervin obtains such a judgment in the state where he seeks to enforce the judgment, he can invoke its judgment-collection procedures to collect the judgment from Ito. Suppose, for example, that Ito lives in the state of Acadia, and has property there that could be sold to satisfy Ervin\u2019s judgment. An Acadia court would not order \u2018\u2018execution\u2019\u2019 on an Emporia judgment, that is, the use of its court procedures to collect the Emporia judgment from Ito\u2019s assets. Acadia courts only enforce Acadia judgments. So, Ervin would have to bring a suit in the courts of Acadia, asking the court to enter an Acadia judgment on the Emporia judgment. This is a new law suit; Ervin\u2019s the plaintiff, Ito\u2019s the defendant. Ito will be served with process in the enforcement action and have an opportunity to raise any defenses he may have. States generally have to honor each other\u2019s judgments, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. Acadia would be bound, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, to recognize the Emporia judgment by entering an Acadia judgment recognizing it. Once that has been done, Ervin has an Acadia judgment against an Acadia defendant, and can use local court procedures to have Ito\u2019s assets sold to satisfy his judgment.1 However, states do not automatically honor all judgments of other states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. A defendant in Ito\u2019s position can raise certain narrow defenses to enforcing the Emporia judgment . . . including the defense that the court that rendered the judgment lacked the power to do so. Even before Pennoyer v. Neff, courts allowed judgment debtors to resist enforcement of judgments on the ground that the court that rendered the judgment lacked personal jurisdiction. In the earlier cases, it was supposed that the [full faith and credit] act gave to all judgments the same effect in other States which they had by law in the State where rendered. But this view was afterwards qualified so as to make the act applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject- matter, and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 729 (1877). So, Ervin may bring his Emporia judgment to Acadia to enforce, and Ito may try to convince the court not to enforce it because the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. In light of this black letter law, consider the following question.  ", " Closers are designed to be tough. So a \u2018\u2018Killer Closer\u2019\u2019 should be even worse. Closers are optional. You have no one to blame but yourself.  The natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she\u2019s been sued in the wrong court is to protest. You\u2019d feel the same way. \u2018\u2018Hey, wait! This case doesn\u2019t belong here; throw it out.\u2019\u2019 All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court\u2019s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019 The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction.

In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here\u2019s a question to test the point. I\u2019ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you\u2019ve read the discussion above it should be easy.  A defendant sued away from home has another option if she believes that the court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. She may ignore the suit entirely. Suppose that Ito, sued by Ervin in Emporia, never moves to dismiss, never appears specially, simply ignores the law suit. What will happen? The court will very likely assume that Ito has no defense to the claim, and enter a default judgment for Ervin on the claim. But who cares? If Ito has no property in Emporia, and no plans to go there personally, Ervin won\u2019t be able to collect the judgment there. He will have to come to Ito\u2019s state to enforce the judgment. This is often done by bringing an action for a \u2018\u2018judgment on the judgment\u2019\u2019 in the enforcing state, to convert the Emporia judgment into a judgment of the enforcing state. Once Ervin obtains such a judgment in the state where he seeks to enforce the judgment, he can invoke its judgment-collection procedures to collect the judgment from Ito. Suppose, for example, that Ito lives in the state of Acadia, and has property there that could be sold to satisfy Ervin\u2019s judgment. An Acadia court would not order \u2018\u2018execution\u2019\u2019 on an Emporia judgment, that is, the use of its court procedures to collect the Emporia judgment from Ito\u2019s assets. Acadia courts only enforce Acadia judgments. So, Ervin would have to bring a suit in the courts of Acadia, asking the court to enter an Acadia judgment on the Emporia judgment. This is a new law suit; Ervin\u2019s the plaintiff, Ito\u2019s the defendant. Ito will be served with process in the enforcement action and have an opportunity to raise any defenses he may have. States generally have to honor each other\u2019s judgments, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. Acadia would be bound, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, to recognize the Emporia judgment by entering an Acadia judgment recognizing it. Once that has been done, Ervin has an Acadia judgment against an Acadia defendant, and can use local court procedures to have Ito\u2019s assets sold to satisfy his judgment.1 However, states do not automatically honor all judgments of other states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. A defendant in Ito\u2019s position can raise certain narrow defenses to enforcing the Emporia judgment . . . including the defense that the court that rendered the judgment lacked the power to do so. Even before Pennoyer v. Neff, courts allowed judgment debtors to resist enforcement of judgments on the ground that the court that rendered the judgment lacked personal jurisdiction. In the earlier cases, it was supposed that the [full faith and credit] act gave to all judgments the same effect in other States which they had by law in the State where rendered. But this view was afterwards qualified so as to make the act applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject- matter, and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 729 (1877). So, Ervin may bring his Emporia judgment to Acadia to enforce, and Ito may try to convince the court not to enforce it because the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him.

Jhala is injured while riding an off-road vehicle over the dunes. He retains a lawyer, Pope, to bring suit against Adventure Vehicles, Inc., the company that manufactured the ORV. Pope files suit, seeking recovery on a theory of strict products liability, that is, that the defendant is liable without fault for selling a defective vehicle that injured Jhala. His theory is that the ORV was built with too narrow a wheelbase, making it dangerously prone to rolling over. He also asserts a negligence claim against Adventure, on the theory that it negligently designed the ORV. Adventure answers the complaint, denying that the ORV was defectively designed, denying that it was negligently designed, and alleging as an affirmative defense that Jhala was negligent for driving it too fast on a steep slope. After discovery based on these pleadings, the case goes to trial. To support its comparative negligence defense, Adventure presents evidence about Jhala\u2019s route at the time of the accident, his speed, and the slope of the hill where the accident occurred. Jhala introduces opposing evidence on these issues. After both parties have rested their cases, Adventure seeks a jury instruction on the theory of assumption of the risk.

Tompkins\u2019s accident took place in Pennsylvania, but he brought suit against the railroad in New York. Erie clearly requires the federal court to apply state law to his claim, but which state\u2019s law, Pennsylvania\u2019s\u2014where the accident happened\u2014or New York\u2019s, where the case was filed? Because the case has connections with both states, each would have a basis for applying its own law to it. How is the federal court to choose between the two bodies of state tort law? Every state has \u2018\u2018choice-of-law\u2019\u2019 rules to deal with this problem, which arises frequently in state cases as well as federal diversity cases. For example, for many years the states used the \u2018\u2018lex loci delicti\u2019\u2019 choice-of-law rule in tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of injury, even if the suit were filed in a different state. Similarly, in contracts cases, traditional choice-of-law doctrine looked to the contract law of the place where the contract was formed. After Erie established that federal diversity courts had to apply state law, federal courts faced the further problem of choosing which state\u2019s law to use in a case like Erie. Should federal courts develop their own \u2018\u2018choice-of-law\u2019\u2019 rules for diversity cases, or borrow from the states? Three years after Erie, the Supreme Court addressed this issue in Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941). Klaxon held that a federal diversity court should use the choice-of-law rules of the state in which it sits. Thus, a New York federal court should apply whatever state substantive law the New York state court would apply to the case. If a New York court, under its choice-of-law rules, would apply New York tort law to Tompkins\u2019s accident (even though it took place in Pennsylvania), the New York federal court should do so as well. On the other hand, if a New York court would, under its choice-of-law rule for torts, apply Pennsylvania law to Tompkins\u2019s case, the New York federal court should similarly look to Pennsylvania law. Klaxon reasoned that Erie required that the case come out the same way in federal court that it would in the state courts of the state where the federal court sat. To further that uniformity goal, the federal court should choose whatever body of tort law (or contract law or other state law) the local state court would. When Erie was decided, most courts applied the lex loci delicti choice of law rule to tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of the injury. Under the lex loci rule, there was little doubt that, if a New York state court heard Tompkins\u2019s case, it would apply Pennsylvania tort law to it. So a federal court in New York would also look to Pennsylvania tort law to decide the case. Today, however, states use widely divergent choice-of-law rules. One state might use the place-of-the-injury rule in a tort case, another might look to the interests of the various states connected to the case, and another state might apply its own law as long as the case has some connection to it. It is entirely possible, under this balkanized approach to choice of law, that a New York court would apply New York law to a case, even though, had the case been filed in Pennsylvania, that court would have chosen its law\u2014or that of a third state\u2014to govern the same case. Since New York courts and Pennsylvania courts might apply different bodies of tort law to a case, it follows, under Klaxon, that federal courts in those states might also end up applying different tort rules to the same dispute. If the New York federal court uses New York\u2019s choice of law rules to select the proper tort law (as it must under Klaxon), it might select New York law in a case like Tompkins\u2019s, because a New York state court would, under its choice-of-law rules. But, if Pennsylvania uses different choice of law rules, a Pennsylvania federal court using Pennsylvania choice of law rules might apply Pennsylvania law, if Tompkins sued there. So Tompkins\u2019s lawyers might find, even now, that by selecting a federal court in one state rather than another, they can still shop for more favorable law, since the federal court in each state will use local choice-of-law rules to select the applicable substantive law. The Klaxon Court recognized that its holding posed this risk, but shrugged it off as inevitable: Whatever lack of uniformity this may produce between federal courts in different states is attributable to our federal system, which leaves to a state, within the limits permitted by the Constitution, the right to pursue local policies diverging from those of its neighbors. 313 U.S. at 496.

For example, for many years the states used the \u2018\u2018lex loci delicti\u2019\u2019 choice-of-law rule in tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of injury, even if the suit were filed in a different state. Similarly, in contracts cases, traditional choice-of-law doctrine looked to the contract law of the place where the contract was formed. After Erie established that federal diversity courts had to apply state law, federal courts faced the further problem of choosing which state\u2019s law to use in a case like Erie. Should federal courts develop their own \u2018\u2018choice-of-law\u2019\u2019 rules for diversity cases, or borrow from the states? Three years after Erie, the Supreme Court addressed this issue in Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487 (1941). Klaxon held that a federal diversity court should use the choice-of-law rules of the state in which it sits. Thus, a New York federal court should apply whatever state substantive law the New York state court would apply to the case. If a New York court, under its choice-of-law rules, would apply New York tort law to Tompkins\u2019s accident (even though it took place in Pennsylvania), the New York federal court should do so as well. On the other hand, if a New York court would, under its choice-of-law rule for torts, apply Pennsylvania law to Tompkins\u2019s case, the New York federal court should similarly look to Pennsylvania law. Klaxon reasoned that Erie required that the case come out the same way in federal court that it would in the state courts of the state where the federal court sat. To further that uniformity goal, the federal court should choose whatever body of tort law (or contract law or other state law) the local state court would. When Erie was decided, most courts applied the lex loci delicti choice of law rule to tort cases, which looked to the tort law of the place of the injury. Under the lex loci rule, there was little doubt that, if a New York state court heard Tompkins\u2019s case, it would apply Pennsylvania tort law to it. So a federal court in New York would also look to Pennsylvania tort law to decide the case. Today, however, states use widely divergent choice-of-law rules. One state might use the place-of-the-injury rule in a tort case, another might look to the interests of the various states connected to the case, and another state might apply its own law as long as the case has some connection to it. It is entirely possible, under this balkanized approach to choice of law, that a New York court would apply New York law to a case, even though, had the case been filed in Pennsylvania, that court would have chosen its law\u2014or that of a third state\u2014to govern the same case. Since New York courts and Pennsylvania courts might apply different bodies of tort law to a case, it follows, under Klaxon, that federal courts in those states might also end up applying different tort rules to the same dispute. If the New York federal court uses New York\u2019s choice of law rules to select the proper tort law (as it must under Klaxon), it might select New York law in a case like Tompkins\u2019s, because a New York state court would, under its choice-of-law rules. But, if Pennsylvania uses different choice of law rules, a Pennsylvania federal court using Pennsylvania choice of law rules might apply Pennsylvania law, if Tompkins sued there. So Tompkins\u2019s lawyers might find, even now, that by selecting a federal court in one state rather than another, they can still shop for more favorable law, since the federal court in each state will use local choice-of-law rules to select the applicable substantive law. The Klaxon Court recognized that its holding posed this risk, but shrugged it off as inevitable: Whatever lack of uniformity this may produce between federal courts in different states is attributable to our federal system, which leaves to a state, within the limits permitted by the Constitution, the right to pursue local policies diverging from those of its neighbors. 313 U.S. at 496. So, the bottom line is that a federal diversity court must apply whatever state law the courts of the state in which it sits would apply. In cases with connections to more than one state, this adds a second layer to the Erie analysis.\n\nQuestion:\n8. Your law or mine? Whitney, a Rhode Island citizen, goes skiing at a ski area in Vermont. When he purchases his lift ticket, he quickly signs a release of liability, waiving his right to sue, should he be injured due to negligence of the operator. While coming down an expert trail, he comes suddenly upon a bare spot full of rocks. He falls and is injured. He brings a diversity action against the operator in federal court in Rhode Island, basing personal jurisdiction on the fact that it had sent him an offer there for a weekend ski package that induced him to go to Vermont to ski. Assume that Rhode Island tort law refuses to enforce advance waivers of liability for negligence, unless they were individually negotiated. Assume further that Vermont tort law holds such waivers enforceable. Assume further that Rhode Island\u2019s choice-of-law rule for tort cases is to apply the law of the place of the injury, while Vermont\u2019s choice-of-law rule involves an assessment of the interests of the parties and states involved. It is less predictable under this balancing approach to choice of law whether the court would apply Rhode Island or Vermont law.

The York/Hanna doctrine is hard. So the Closer here is just another Closer. Consider again the two prongs of the Hanna analysis in choosing the best answer.  That is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer. But Hanna changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In Hanna, Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule. York and Byrd both involved such conflicts. York involved a conflict between a state statute and the judicial practice of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And Byrd involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal judicial practice of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these \u2018\u2018relatively unguided\u2019\u2019 Erie conflicts, Hanna reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in Byrd\u2019s language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because \u2018\u2018there can be no other law.\u2019\u2019 Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury\u2019s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy Erie sought to further\u2014uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts\u2014but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the Hanna opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of York\u2019s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are not prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and \u2018\u2018inequitable administration of the laws,\u2019\u2019 that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York line of cases would not require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following Question 1.) That\u2019s Hanna Part I. It\u2019s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in Hanna, unlike in York or in Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna construed Congress\u2019s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is \u2018\u2018rationally capable of classification\u2019\u2019 as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the \u2018\u2018outcome-determinative\u2019\u2019 test of York, or the more refined outcome-determinative test of Hanna Part I. But the rule involved in Hanna wasn\u2019t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to \u2018\u2018prescribe general rules of practice and procedure\u2019\u2019 for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a). In Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress\u2019s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted \u00a72072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that \u2018\u2018really regulates procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\u2019\u2019 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress\u2019s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress\u2019s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court\u2019s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b) provides that the Rules \u2018\u2018shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u2019\u2019 Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, \u00a72072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \u00a72072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and\u2014even if it is\u2014it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the \u2018\u2018modified outcome-determinative test\u2019\u2019 of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the \u2018\u2018Supreme Law of the Land.\u2019\u2019 United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under Hanna Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under Hanna Part II? \n\nQuestion:\n7.

Her claim is for an injury she suffered in Tennessee, when she was hit by a bullet fired by one of a group of hunters. Her injuries are grievous, so her damages evidence will be graphic and moving. There is a significant question in the case as to whether it was Moriarty who shot her. Moriarty moves to bifurcate the trial, that is, to try the issue of whether his bullet hit Columbus first\u2014and have the jury decide it\u2014before trying the damages issues. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) authorizes federal courts to order a separate trial of one or more issues \u2018\u2018in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice.\u2019\u2019 However, Tennessee has a state constitutional provision that has been interpreted to require a single, unified trial of all the issues in a suit. The federal judge grants the motion for a separate trial, and the jury finds that it was not Moriarty\u2019s bullet that hit Columbus. Judgment therefore enters for Moriarty.

In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted \u00a72072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that \u2018\u2018really regulates procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\u2019\u2019 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress\u2019s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress\u2019s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court\u2019s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b) provides that the Rules \u2018\u2018shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u2019\u2019 Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, \u00a72072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \u00a72072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and\u2014even if it is\u2014it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the \u2018\u2018modified outcome-determinative test\u2019\u2019 of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the \u2018\u2018Supreme Law of the Land.\u2019\u2019 United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under Hanna Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under Hanna Part II? \n\nQuestion:\n7. A matter of procedure? Columbus sues Moriarty in federal court, based on diversity jurisdiction. Her claim is for an injury she suffered in Tennessee, when she was hit by a bullet fired by one of a group of hunters. Her injuries are grievous, so her damages evidence will be graphic and moving. There is a significant question in the case as to whether it was Moriarty who shot her. Moriarty moves to bifurcate the trial, that is, to try the issue of whether his bullet hit Columbus first\u2014and have the jury decide it\u2014before trying the damages issues. Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(b) authorizes federal courts to order a separate trial of one or more issues \u2018\u2018in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice.\u2019\u2019 However, Tennessee has a state constitutional provision that has been interpreted to require a single, unified trial of all the issues in a suit. The federal judge grants the motion for a separate trial, and the jury finds that it was not Moriarty\u2019s bullet that hit Columbus. Judgment therefore enters for Moriarty. Columbus appeals, arguing that the court should have applied the state unified-trial approach. The Court of Appeals should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nreverse the judgment, because the Rule abridges a substantive right and is therefore invalid under the second subsection of the REA.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nNow remember, this is the Closer. Don\u2019t blame me if it\u2019s technical, the rules are technical. My students always confuse crossclaims, counterclaims, and Rule 14 claims. They call one the other, refer to the wrong rule numbers, and get very frustrated. Well, it is confusing, but the best antidote is to simply remember the basic distinctions and apply them systematically. A counterclaim is a claim asserted by a defending party\u2014someone who is on the receiving end of a claim\u2014back against the party who has asserted a claim against him. A crossclaim is a claim asserted against a coparty, that is, a codefendant or coplaintiff on a claim. However, be careful about situations where a party asserts a claim against a coparty (a crossclaim) and the defending party on that crossclaim has a claim back against the claimant. For example, Parker, a codefendant in a case with Spanogle, asserts a claim against Spanogle for contribution, and Spanogle then asserts a claim back against Parker for his own injuries in the accident. In this situation, Spanogle\u2019s claim is a counterclaim. Once Parker asserted a crossclaim against him, he became a \u2018\u2018defending party.\u2019\u2019 Any claim he has against Parker, who asserted the claim against him, is therefore a counterclaim. Once we add Rule 14(a) to the mix, this becomes even more elegant, because Rule 14(a)(3) and (2)(D) allow the plaintiff to assert claims against the third-party defendant and vice versa. For example, if Moretti sues Parker and Spanogle, and Spanogle impleads Adair for contribution, Rule 14(a)(3) allows Moretti, the plaintiff, to assert a claim directly against Adair, the third-party defendant. But this claim is not a counterclaim. Why not? Because a counterclaim is a claim against an opposing party, and, until Moretti asserts a claim against Adair, they are not opposing parties. They are both litigants in the case, but no claim runs between them, until Moretti (or Adair) asserts one. Here\u2019s a stubbornly technical question that asks you to sort all this out. (A diagram is a must here to sort out these complex variations.)  Rule 13, which governs \u2018\u2018counterclaims,\u2019\u2019 allows defending parties to assert claims against parties who bring claims against them. For example, if Lutsky sues Rowe for his injuries in the three-car collision, Rule 13 allows Rowe, the defendant, to assert a claim for his own injuries in the collision against Lutsky. Under Rule 13, a counterclaim is either compulsory or permissive. Rule 13(a) governs compulsory counterclaims: Fed. R. Civ. P. 13. (a) Compulsory counterclaim. (1) In General. A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that \u2014at the time of its service\u2014the pleader has against an opposing party, if the claim: (A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim; and (B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. Rowe\u2019s counterclaim for his injuries in the collision would be compulsory, since it arises from the same accident as Lutsky\u2019s claim against him. Rule 13 (b) allows a defending party (like Rowe) to assert any claims he has against the opposing party that do not arise out of the same events. Between the two, they cover the ground: Any claim that a defending party has against her opponent may be included. But some of them\u2014compulsory counterclaims\u2014must be. This ensures efficiency, since the same issues are likely to arise on the counterclaim, and the same witnesses to be called to testify if the counterclaim is compulsory. And litigating the opposing claims together will avoid inconsistent verdicts on the issues, which could result if the claim and counterclaim are submitted to different juries. However, litigants, like other people, don\u2019t always follow the rules. What will happen if Rowe has a claim against Lutsky, but does not assert it as a counterclaim in Lutsky\u2019s suit? (Consider Rule 13(h) in analyzing this question.)  There are further permutations on the joinder problem. Rule 13(g) authorizes another variation, the crossclaim. A crossclaim is a claim against a coparty, for example, a claim by one defendant against a codefendant, or by one plaintiff against another plaintiff. Crossclaims are authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(g): A pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross- claimant. The basic point is simple: If you\u2019re sued along with another defendant, and you have a claim against the other defendant that arises from the same underlying dispute, you may assert it as a \u2018\u2018crossclaim\u2019\u2019 in the same action. Suppose, for example, that Hammer hires Milsap to build a house for him, and Milsap subcontracts the wiring work to Rosov. The wiring fails, and Hammer sues Milsap, the general contractor, and Rosov, the wiring subcontractor, for damages. Milsap and Rosov are codefendants. Rule 13(g) allows either one to assert claims against the other codefendant arising out of the wiring work. This promotes efficiency in resolving the entire dispute among the parties. It also avoids the potential for inconsistent factual findings, which could happen if claims between Milsap and Rosov arising from this job were litigated separately: If two juries considered the issue of the cause of the failed wiring, one might attribute it to Milsap, and the other to Rosov. Here\u2019s a slightly more complex example building on the Milsap/Rosov hypothetical.  Now let\u2019s tackle Rule 14. Remember that basically, the plaintiff designs her lawsuit. She decides whom she will sue and with whom she will join as co-plaintiffs. The federal rulemakers have generally accepted this premise that the \u2018\u2018plaintiff is master of her claim.\u2019\u2019 But Rule 14 is an exception. It gives defending parties a limited opportunity to bring in a new party to the action, to redesign the suit. But the opportunity really is limited: Under Rule 14(a), a defending party may only bring in a \u2018\u2018third- party defendant\u2019\u2019 in order to pass on all or part of her liability to the party seeking relief from her: Fed. R. Civ. P. 14. Third Party Practice (a) When a Defending Party May Bring in a Third Party. (1) . . . A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it [i.e., to the third-party plaintiff, that is, the original defendant!] for all or part of the claim against it. Under Rule 14(a)(1), a defendant cannot bring in a person who might be liable to the plaintiff only. Nor can she bring in a person who might be liable to her (the defendant) for some related damage that she has suffered. She may only bring in a third-party defendant who may be responsible to reimburse her for part, or all, of the judgment the plaintiff recovers from her. This usually arises in two situations. First, it frequently occurs where a party is liable for an injury but has a right of reimbursement for the damages from another party. For example, a retailer who sold a defective product to a consumer is frequently liable for injuries from the defective product, but can demand indemnification from the manufacturer. If the retailer is sued, it can bring in the manufacturer under Rule 14(a), claiming that the manufacturer is liable to reimburse the retailer for the entire damages awarded against it. Second, Rule 14(a) applies where one defendant has a right to force another party to share in a judgment the plaintiff recovers. Suppose that two drivers cause an accident, and the injured party sues one of the drivers. In many states, that driver, if negligent, would be liable to the injured plaintiff for her full damages, but would have a right to recover \u2018\u2018contribution\u2019\u2019\u2014part of the damages she pays to the plaintiff\u2014from the other driver if the second driver was negligent too. So Driver 1 could implead Driver 2 under Rule 14(a) for contribution. In this common scenario, the primary defendant is trying to recover from the third-party defendant part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the third-party plaintiff [the defendant]. Consider the following example. Recall that supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a) generally allows the court to hear proper Rule 14(a) claims. \n\nQuestion:\n8. Wrong turn. Iannotti was driving a tractor-trailer down the interstate when a tire blew out. He swerved toward the breakdown lane to stop. Nickles was parked in the breakdown lane arguing with his girlfriend on his cell phone. Skolnick, driving on Iannotti\u2019s right, tried to speed up to get out of the way, but was unable to do so because Erskine, in the car in front of him, didn\u2019t speed up or turn. The swerving truck forced him into the breakdown lane, where he crashed into Nickles\u2019s car. The truck and Erskine\u2019s car collided as well. Skolnick sued Iannotti and Erskine in federal court for his injuries, claiming that their negligent acts led to the accident. He also sued Maria, Erskine\u2019s mechanic, because Erskine maintained that he had tried to avoid the accident but his accelerator, which had just been repaired by Maria, did not respond. Erskine asserted a claim against Iannotti for contribution, in the event that he was held liable to Skolnick. Iannotti then asserted a claim against Erskine for contribution, and for his own injuries in the accident. Maria brought a claim against Nickles for contribution, claiming that Nickles was negligent in parking in the breakdown lane to argue with his girlfriend. Not to be outdone, Nickles asserted a claim against Skolnick for his injuries. Skolnick then asserted a claim for his injuries against Nickles.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nErskine\u2019s claim against Iannotti is a crossclaim, Iannotti\u2019s claims against Erskine and Skolnick\u2019s claim against Nickles, are counterclaims. Nickles\u2019s claim against Skolnick is neither a crossclaim nor a counterclaim.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nNow remember, this is the Closer.

It also avoids the potential for inconsistent factual findings, which could happen if claims between Milsap and Rosov arising from this job were litigated separately: If two juries considered the issue of the cause of the failed wiring, one might attribute it to Milsap, and the other to Rosov. Here\u2019s a slightly more complex example building on the Milsap/Rosov hypothetical.  Now let\u2019s tackle Rule 14. Remember that basically, the plaintiff designs her lawsuit. She decides whom she will sue and with whom she will join as co-plaintiffs. The federal rulemakers have generally accepted this premise that the \u2018\u2018plaintiff is master of her claim.\u2019\u2019 But Rule 14 is an exception. It gives defending parties a limited opportunity to bring in a new party to the action, to redesign the suit. But the opportunity really is limited: Under Rule 14(a), a defending party may only bring in a \u2018\u2018third- party defendant\u2019\u2019 in order to pass on all or part of her liability to the party seeking relief from her: Fed. R. Civ. P. 14. Third Party Practice (a) When a Defending Party May Bring in a Third Party. (1) . . . A defending party may, as third-party plaintiff, serve a summons and complaint on a nonparty who is or may be liable to it [i.e., to the third-party plaintiff, that is, the original defendant!] for all or part of the claim against it. Under Rule 14(a)(1), a defendant cannot bring in a person who might be liable to the plaintiff only. Nor can she bring in a person who might be liable to her (the defendant) for some related damage that she has suffered. She may only bring in a third-party defendant who may be responsible to reimburse her for part, or all, of the judgment the plaintiff recovers from her. This usually arises in two situations. First, it frequently occurs where a party is liable for an injury but has a right of reimbursement for the damages from another party. For example, a retailer who sold a defective product to a consumer is frequently liable for injuries from the defective product, but can demand indemnification from the manufacturer. If the retailer is sued, it can bring in the manufacturer under Rule 14(a), claiming that the manufacturer is liable to reimburse the retailer for the entire damages awarded against it. Second, Rule 14(a) applies where one defendant has a right to force another party to share in a judgment the plaintiff recovers. Suppose that two drivers cause an accident, and the injured party sues one of the drivers. In many states, that driver, if negligent, would be liable to the injured plaintiff for her full damages, but would have a right to recover \u2018\u2018contribution\u2019\u2019\u2014part of the damages she pays to the plaintiff\u2014from the other driver if the second driver was negligent too. So Driver 1 could implead Driver 2 under Rule 14(a) for contribution. In this common scenario, the primary defendant is trying to recover from the third-party defendant part of the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the third-party plaintiff [the defendant]. Consider the following example. Recall that supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a) generally allows the court to hear proper Rule 14(a) claims. \n\nQuestion:\n8. Wrong turn. Iannotti was driving a tractor-trailer down the interstate when a tire blew out. He swerved toward the breakdown lane to stop. Nickles was parked in the breakdown lane arguing with his girlfriend on his cell phone. Skolnick, driving on Iannotti\u2019s right, tried to speed up to get out of the way, but was unable to do so because Erskine, in the car in front of him, didn\u2019t speed up or turn. The swerving truck forced him into the breakdown lane, where he crashed into Nickles\u2019s car. The truck and Erskine\u2019s car collided as well. Skolnick sued Iannotti and Erskine in federal court for his injuries, claiming that their negligent acts led to the accident. He also sued Maria, Erskine\u2019s mechanic, because Erskine maintained that he had tried to avoid the accident but his accelerator, which had just been repaired by Maria, did not respond. Erskine asserted a claim against Iannotti for contribution, in the event that he was held liable to Skolnick. Iannotti then asserted a claim against Erskine for contribution, and for his own injuries in the accident. Maria brought a claim against Nickles for contribution, claiming that Nickles was negligent in parking in the breakdown lane to argue with his girlfriend. Not to be outdone, Nickles asserted a claim against Skolnick for his injuries. Skolnick then asserted a claim for his injuries against Nickles.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nSkolnick\u2019s claim against Nickles and Iannotti\u2019s first claim against Erskine are counterclaims, Iannotti\u2019s second claim against Erskine is a crossclaim.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nNow remember, this is the Closer. Don\u2019t blame me if it\u2019s technical, the rules are technical. My students always confuse crossclaims, counterclaims, and Rule 14 claims. They call one the other, refer to the wrong rule numbers, and get very frustrated. Well, it is confusing, but the best antidote is to simply remember the basic distinctions and apply them systematically. A counterclaim is a claim asserted by a defending party\u2014someone who is on the receiving end of a claim\u2014back against the party who has asserted a claim against him. A crossclaim is a claim asserted against a coparty, that is, a codefendant or coplaintiff on a claim. However, be careful about situations where a party asserts a claim against a coparty (a crossclaim) and the defending party on that crossclaim has a claim back against the claimant. For example, Parker, a codefendant in a case with Spanogle, asserts a claim against Spanogle for contribution, and Spanogle then asserts a claim back against Parker for his own injuries in the accident. In this situation, Spanogle\u2019s claim is a counterclaim. Once Parker asserted a crossclaim against him, he became a \u2018\u2018defending party.\u2019\u2019 Any claim he has against Parker, who asserted the claim against him, is therefore a counterclaim. Once we add Rule 14(a) to the mix, this becomes even more elegant, because Rule 14(a)(3) and (2)(D) allow the plaintiff to assert claims against the third-party defendant and vice versa. For example, if Moretti sues Parker and Spanogle, and Spanogle impleads Adair for contribution, Rule 14(a)(3) allows Moretti, the plaintiff, to assert a claim directly against Adair, the third-party defendant. But this claim is not a counterclaim. Why not? Because a counterclaim is a claim against an opposing party, and, until Moretti asserts a claim against Adair, they are not opposing parties. They are both litigants in the case, but no claim runs between them, until Moretti (or Adair) asserts one. Here\u2019s a stubbornly technical question that asks you to sort all this out. (A diagram is a must here to sort out these complex variations.)  Rule 13, which governs \u2018\u2018counterclaims,\u2019\u2019 allows defending parties to assert claims against parties who bring claims against them. For example, if Lutsky sues Rowe for his injuries in the three-car collision, Rule 13 allows Rowe, the defendant, to assert a claim for his own injuries in the collision against Lutsky. Under Rule 13, a counterclaim is either compulsory or permissive. Rule 13(a) governs compulsory counterclaims: Fed. R. Civ. P. 13. (a) Compulsory counterclaim. (1) In General. A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that \u2014at the time of its service\u2014the pleader has against an opposing party, if the claim: (A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party\u2019s claim; and (B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. Rowe\u2019s counterclaim for his injuries in the collision would be compulsory, since it arises from the same accident as Lutsky\u2019s claim against him. Rule 13 (b) allows a defending party (like Rowe) to assert any claims he has against the opposing party that do not arise out of the same events. Between the two, they cover the ground: Any claim that a defending party has against her opponent may be included. But some of them\u2014compulsory counterclaims\u2014must be. This ensures efficiency, since the same issues are likely to arise on the counterclaim, and the same witnesses to be called to testify if the counterclaim is compulsory. And litigating the opposing claims together will avoid inconsistent verdicts on the issues, which could result if the claim and counterclaim are submitted to different juries. However, litigants, like other people, don\u2019t always follow the rules. What will happen if Rowe has a claim against Lutsky, but does not assert it as a counterclaim in Lutsky\u2019s suit? (Consider Rule 13(h) in analyzing this question.)  There are further permutations on the joinder problem. Rule 13(g) authorizes another variation, the crossclaim. A crossclaim is a claim against a coparty, for example, a claim by one defendant against a codefendant, or by one plaintiff against another plaintiff. Crossclaims are authorized by Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(g): A pleading may state as a crossclaim any claim by one party against a coparty if the claim arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the original action or of a counterclaim, or if the claim relates to any property that is the subject matter of the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the cross-claimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the cross- claimant. The basic point is simple: If you\u2019re sued along with another defendant, and you have a claim against the other defendant that arises from the same underlying dispute, you may assert it as a \u2018\u2018crossclaim\u2019\u2019 in the same action. Suppose, for example, that Hammer hires Milsap to build a house for him, and Milsap subcontracts the wiring work to Rosov. The wiring fails, and Hammer sues Milsap, the general contractor, and Rosov, the wiring subcontractor, for damages. Milsap and Rosov are codefendants. Rule 13(g) allows either one to assert claims against the other codefendant arising out of the wiring work. This promotes efficiency in resolving the entire dispute among the parties. It also avoids the potential for inconsistent factual findings, which could happen if claims between Milsap and Rosov arising from this job were litigated separately: If two juries considered the issue of the cause of the failed wiring, one might attribute it to Milsap, and the other to Rosov. Here\u2019s a slightly more complex example building on the Milsap/Rosov hypothetical.  Now let\u2019s tackle Rule 14. Remember that basically, the plaintiff designs her lawsuit.

The idea is to put the defendant on notice of the positions that you may seek to establish, not a single one you have settled on irrevocably. The same goes for the defendant. Under Rule 8, the defendant is allowed to plead whatever defenses she has to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. She may take inconsistent positions about the facts or the law, and may raise multiple defenses without choosing among them. The defendant might, for example, deny that she was negligent, but also allege that the plaintiff was more negligent than she was and is therefore barred from recovery. She might deny that she had a contract with the plaintiff, raise as a second defense that she did not breach, and raise as a third defense that the statute of limitations bars recovery. Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn\u2019t required to stake her case on one of them. Although Rule 11(b)(3) requires support for affirmative defenses as well as factual allegations in the original complaint, it is unfortunately common for defendants to \u2018\u2018overplead\u2019\u2019 affirmative defenses.

Doubtless, counsel view the risk of sanctions for overpleading defenses as less grievous than the risk of waiving a defense by failing to assert it. The unfortunate side effect of this, however, is that such answers do not fully serve the purpose the rule-makers envisioned: to reveal the parties\u2019 real positions and to narrow the scope of controverted issues. Here\u2019s a question that explores the defendant\u2019s options.  Rule 8 contains simple, sensible provisions governing the defendant\u2019s responses to the allegations in the complaint. First, Rule 8(b) requires the defendant to admit or deny each of the allegations in the complaint. Usually, this is done paragraph by paragraph. Rule 10(b) requires that averments in the complaint be set forth in separate paragraphs. The defendant, in answering, must take a position on each of these allegations, by admitting those that are true, and denying those that aren\u2019t. Under Rule 8(b)(2), a \u2018\u2018denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.\u2019\u2019 If the defendant means to deny only a part of an allegation, she must specify what is true and deny only the parts that are not. Failing to deny an allegation constitutes an admission of it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6). The idea is that, if the parties plead conscientiously by the Rules, the parties and the court can compare the allegations in the complaint and the responses in the answer, and determine which issues are contested and which are agreed upon (and therefore need not be litigated). If all goes right, this simple pleading process can narrow the scope of the dispute considerably. The Rule also recognizes that the defendant may not know whether some allegations in the complaint are true or not. If she has grounds to deny them, she may do so, but if she just doesn\u2019t know, or doesn\u2019t have the information necessary to admit or deny at the time of pleading, she may respond that she \u2018\u2018lacks knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief about the truth of an allegation.\u2019\u2019 Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(5). Under the rule, this response to an allegation \u2018\u2018has the effect of a denial.\u2019\u2019 To determine what issues remain in dispute, of course, the plaintiff\u2014 and the court\u2014have to read the defendant\u2019s answer in light of the provisions of the pleading rules.

Cardozo is in an accident on Main Street with two other cars, driven by Hooper and Lopes. Cardozo brings a suit in federal court against Hooper and Lopes for his damages. Paragraph 21 of Cardozo\u2019s complaint alleges that Hooper had signaled before he turned onto Main Street. The police report on the accident states that, according to a bystander, Hooper had signaled before turning onto Main Street. Lopes, who was coming from Hooper\u2019s left, had no view of the right side of Hooper\u2019s car, and did not see whether he signaled or not. At the time an answer is due, Lopes\u2019s counsel has seen the police report, but has not yet been able to locate other witnesses to obtain their testimony.

The idea is to put the defendant on notice of the positions that you may seek to establish, not a single one you have settled on irrevocably. The same goes for the defendant. Under Rule 8, the defendant is allowed to plead whatever defenses she has to the plaintiff\u2019s claim. She may take inconsistent positions about the facts or the law, and may raise multiple defenses without choosing among them. The defendant might, for example, deny that she was negligent, but also allege that the plaintiff was more negligent than she was and is therefore barred from recovery. She might deny that she had a contract with the plaintiff, raise as a second defense that she did not breach, and raise as a third defense that the statute of limitations bars recovery. Under Rule 11, she must have evidentiary support for the defenses she asserts, but isn\u2019t required to stake her case on one of them. Although Rule 11(b)(3) requires support for affirmative defenses as well as factual allegations in the original complaint, it is unfortunately common for defendants to \u2018\u2018overplead\u2019\u2019 affirmative defenses. Given the short period for filing an answer, and the potential for malpractice exposure for failing to raise a defense, many answers include a long list of \u2018\u2018boilerplate\u2019\u2019 defenses, many clearly irrelevant to the case. Doubtless, counsel view the risk of sanctions for overpleading defenses as less grievous than the risk of waiving a defense by failing to assert it. The unfortunate side effect of this, however, is that such answers do not fully serve the purpose the rule-makers envisioned: to reveal the parties\u2019 real positions and to narrow the scope of controverted issues. Here\u2019s a question that explores the defendant\u2019s options.  Rule 8 contains simple, sensible provisions governing the defendant\u2019s responses to the allegations in the complaint. First, Rule 8(b) requires the defendant to admit or deny each of the allegations in the complaint. Usually, this is done paragraph by paragraph. Rule 10(b) requires that averments in the complaint be set forth in separate paragraphs. The defendant, in answering, must take a position on each of these allegations, by admitting those that are true, and denying those that aren\u2019t. Under Rule 8(b)(2), a \u2018\u2018denial must fairly respond to the substance of the allegation.\u2019\u2019 If the defendant means to deny only a part of an allegation, she must specify what is true and deny only the parts that are not. Failing to deny an allegation constitutes an admission of it. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(b)(6).

For example, in a breach of contract case, Smith might try to develop evidence that, if the contract was not enforceable, the defendant had been unjustly enriched, so that Smith should recover in quantum meruit. Even though Smith hadn\u2019t pleaded quantum meruit, the course of the parties\u2019 discovery, the manner in which they presented their evidence at trial, their cross-examination of the other side\u2019s witnesses, and their requests for jury instructions might make it clear that they were actually trying the case on both contract and quantum meruit theories. If so, the fact that the quantum meruit claim was never added to the complaint should not prevent consideration of a quantum meruit claim. Similarly, the depositions and cross-examination in a negligence case might show that the defendant relied on the plaintiff\u2019s negligence as a defense (or a partial defense, in a comparative negligence jurisdiction), and that the plaintiff had tried to controvert the defense. Even if the defendant\u2019s answer to the complaint did not raise comparative negligence as a defense, it might be evident to everyone that the parties were litigating that issue. Where this is the case, Rule 15(b) provides that the court may acknowledge the reality that the parties have litigated the issue by allowing an amendment to formally place that issue in contention. Rule 15(b)(1) addresses the situation in which a party objects to evidence at trial on the ground that her opponent is trying to litigate issues at the trial that were not raised in the pleadings. (b) Amendments During and After Trial. (1) Based on an Objection at Trial. If at a trial, a party objects that evidence is not within the issues raised in the pleadings, the court may permit the pleadings to be amended. The court should freely permit an amendment when doing so will aid in presenting the merits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the evidence would prejudice that party\u2019s action or defense on the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence. This subsection addresses the situation in which evidence is offered at trial to establish a claim or defense that is not in the pleadings. The rule permits the judge, if the parties have consciously been litigating the issue to which the offered evidence is relevant, to allow an amendment to the pleadings\u2014at the trial itself\u2014to expressly assert the claim or defense the evidence supports. Of course, if the judge concludes that the objecting party really did not understand that the issue was being litigated, the judge may exclude the evidence and deny an amendment raising the new issue (or allow the amendment and grant a continuance for the objecting party to prepare to litigate the new issue). Rule 15(b)(2) addresses the similar situation in which the parties actually try an issue that is not in the pleadings. If the parties have treated the issue as actually in dispute (such as the plaintiff\u2019s comparative negligence), and presented their evidence on the point, and the jury is instructed on it and decides the issue, Rule 15(b)(2) confirms that the issue is properly tried, even though it was not in the initial pleadings and no amendment raising it was sought during the trial. In either case, the thrust of the rule is to make the pleadings reflect the issues that the parties are really litigating, rather than forcing the parties to litigate only the issues originally pleaded. As with Rule 15(a), the goal is to allow the parties every opportunity, consistent with fair notice to the other side, to try the issues as they are understood by the partner at trial, not as they were initially framed. That does not mean that parties will always convince a judge to hold that issues that were not pleaded are fairly in contention at trial. The key is fairness, and fairness requires notice to the opposing party. Where parties clearly understand that issues are in contention, and are prepared to meet them, the court will allow amendments to the pleadings to confirm that those issues are in the case (or simply act as though they were pleaded without requiring a formal amendment).

Here\u2019s a tough question to illustrate the application of Rule 15(b).\n\nQuestion:\n8. Ups and downs. Jhala is injured while riding an off-road vehicle over the dunes. He retains a lawyer, Pope, to bring suit against Adventure Vehicles, Inc., the company that manufactured the ORV. Pope files suit, seeking recovery on a theory of strict products liability, that is, that the defendant is liable without fault for selling a defective vehicle that injured Jhala. His theory is that the ORV was built with too narrow a wheelbase, making it dangerously prone to rolling over. He also asserts a negligence claim against Adventure, on the theory that it negligently designed the ORV. Adventure answers the complaint, denying that the ORV was defectively designed, denying that it was negligently designed, and alleging as an affirmative defense that Jhala was negligent for driving it too fast on a steep slope. After discovery based on these pleadings, the case goes to trial. To support its comparative negligence defense, Adventure presents evidence about Jhala\u2019s route at the time of the accident, his speed, and the slope of the hill where the accident occurred. Jhala introduces opposing evidence on these issues. After both parties have rested their cases, Adventure seeks a jury instruction on the theory of assumption of the risk. In the state where the action arose, assumption of the risk provides a complete defense to a product liability claim if the plaintiff fully understood a risk posed by a defective product and deliberately chose to encounter the risk anyway. Adventure moves to amend its answer under Rule 15(b)(1) to add a defense of assumption of the risk, so the jury can consider this defense.

In either case, the thrust of the rule is to make the pleadings reflect the issues that the parties are really litigating, rather than forcing the parties to litigate only the issues originally pleaded. As with Rule 15(a), the goal is to allow the parties every opportunity, consistent with fair notice to the other side, to try the issues as they are understood by the partner at trial, not as they were initially framed. That does not mean that parties will always convince a judge to hold that issues that were not pleaded are fairly in contention at trial. The key is fairness, and fairness requires notice to the opposing party. Where parties clearly understand that issues are in contention, and are prepared to meet them, the court will allow amendments to the pleadings to confirm that those issues are in the case (or simply act as though they were pleaded without requiring a formal amendment). However, Rule 15(b) does not allow a party to inject a new issue into the case at trial that was not \u2018\u2018tried by the parties\u2019 express or implied consent.\u2019\u2019 Sometimes, of course, it can be a subtle question whether the parties were consciously litigating an issue, especially where evidence produced at trial is relevant to more than one claim or defense. Here\u2019s a tough question to illustrate the application of Rule 15(b).\n\nQuestion:\n8. Ups and downs. Jhala is injured while riding an off-road vehicle over the dunes. He retains a lawyer, Pope, to bring suit against Adventure Vehicles, Inc., the company that manufactured the ORV. Pope files suit, seeking recovery on a theory of strict products liability, that is, that the defendant is liable without fault for selling a defective vehicle that injured Jhala. His theory is that the ORV was built with too narrow a wheelbase, making it dangerously prone to rolling over. He also asserts a negligence claim against Adventure, on the theory that it negligently designed the ORV. Adventure answers the complaint, denying that the ORV was defectively designed, denying that it was negligently designed, and alleging as an affirmative defense that Jhala was negligent for driving it too fast on a steep slope. After discovery based on these pleadings, the case goes to trial. To support its comparative negligence defense, Adventure presents evidence about Jhala\u2019s route at the time of the accident, his speed, and the slope of the hill where the accident occurred. Jhala introduces opposing evidence on these issues. After both parties have rested their cases, Adventure seeks a jury instruction on the theory of assumption of the risk. In the state where the action arose, assumption of the risk provides a complete defense to a product liability claim if the plaintiff fully understood a risk posed by a defective product and deliberately chose to encounter the risk anyway. Adventure moves to amend its answer under Rule 15(b)(1) to add a defense of assumption of the risk, so the jury can consider this defense. The judge should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ntreat the assumption-of-risk issue as though it had been pleaded, and instruct the jury on it.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nWhile the pleadings are meant to define the scope of the issues litigated at trial, in practice it is not unusual for parties to litigate issues, both in discovery and at trial, that were never pleaded. For example, in a breach of contract case, Smith might try to develop evidence that, if the contract was not enforceable, the defendant had been unjustly enriched, so that Smith should recover in quantum meruit. Even though Smith hadn\u2019t pleaded quantum meruit, the course of the parties\u2019 discovery, the manner in which they presented their evidence at trial, their cross-examination of the other side\u2019s witnesses, and their requests for jury instructions might make it clear that they were actually trying the case on both contract and quantum meruit theories. If so, the fact that the quantum meruit claim was never added to the complaint should not prevent consideration of a quantum meruit claim. Similarly, the depositions and cross-examination in a negligence case might show that the defendant relied on the plaintiff\u2019s negligence as a defense (or a partial defense, in a comparative negligence jurisdiction), and that the plaintiff had tried to controvert the defense. Even if the defendant\u2019s answer to the complaint did not raise comparative negligence as a defense, it might be evident to everyone that the parties were litigating that issue. Where this is the case, Rule 15(b) provides that the court may acknowledge the reality that the parties have litigated the issue by allowing an amendment to formally place that issue in contention. Rule 15(b)(1) addresses the situation in which a party objects to evidence at trial on the ground that her opponent is trying to litigate issues at the trial that were not raised in the pleadings. (b) Amendments During and After Trial. (1) Based on an Objection at Trial. If at a trial, a party objects that evidence is not within the issues raised in the pleadings, the court may permit the pleadings to be amended. The court should freely permit an amendment when doing so will aid in presenting the merits and the objecting party fails to satisfy the court that the evidence would prejudice that party\u2019s action or defense on the merits. The court may grant a continuance to enable the objecting party to meet the evidence. This subsection addresses the situation in which evidence is offered at trial to establish a claim or defense that is not in the pleadings. The rule permits the judge, if the parties have consciously been litigating the issue to which the offered evidence is relevant, to allow an amendment to the pleadings\u2014at the trial itself\u2014to expressly assert the claim or defense the evidence supports. Of course, if the judge concludes that the objecting party really did not understand that the issue was being litigated, the judge may exclude the evidence and deny an amendment raising the new issue (or allow the amendment and grant a continuance for the objecting party to prepare to litigate the new issue). Rule 15(b)(2) addresses the similar situation in which the parties actually try an issue that is not in the pleadings. If the parties have treated the issue as actually in dispute (such as the plaintiff\u2019s comparative negligence), and presented their evidence on the point, and the jury is instructed on it and decides the issue, Rule 15(b)(2) confirms that the issue is properly tried, even though it was not in the initial pleadings and no amendment raising it was sought during the trial. In either case, the thrust of the rule is to make the pleadings reflect the issues that the parties are really litigating, rather than forcing the parties to litigate only the issues originally pleaded.

Let\u2019s round out the discussion with a Closer that\u2014if you want to nail it\u2014will force you do something many of my students resist to the teeth\u2014to actually read the rule. The answers to this Closer are all tucked in there somewhere. Think of it as a litigator\u2019s treasure hunt.  The previous chapters review the rules governing pleading and amendments. They are flexible and expansive, allowing parties to state as many claims as they have, even if inconsistent or contradictory, and to revise their pleadings as they learn more about their cases. These flexible standards for taking positions before the court allow parties a great deal of latitude in asserting claims and defenses that may apply to their cases. However, that latitude does have its limits. Those limits are found in Rule 11. Rule 11 provides that a party (or an unrepresented litigant) makes certain certifications when presenting pleadings, motions, briefs, and arguments to the federal court. The question below gets us started by addressing an important question: What acts of a litigant trigger these certifications under Rule 11? (You should be able to answer this question based on a careful reading of Rule 11(a) and (b).)  Consider the dilemma for the drafters of Rule 11 when establishing ethical limits on asserting legal positions before the court. Surely, they don\u2019t want to prevent lawyers from arguing for legal positions that have not been recognized before. Then the law could never change, because lawyers would be subject to sanctions for arguing for change. Surely, the rule makers also would not want to bar lawyers from arguing for the overruling of established law, for the same reason. But they do want to rein in extravagant or outlandish legal arguments that waste the courts\u2019 time. Rule 11(b) walks this line by requiring that there be a \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous argument\u2019\u2019 for legal positions that are not currently recognized or would require the court to overrule current law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), an advocate certifies to the court that the legal positions taken in a pleading, motion or other paper are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law. Under Rule 11(b)(2), the party asserting a legal position must have a rational argument for the position asserted, a position that has not been definitively rejected by the courts of the jurisdiction so recently that nothing but obstinacy would lead a lawyer to try again. Such \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous\u2019\u2019 arguments might be based on precedents from other states, dissenting opinions, changes by the appellate courts of the relevant state in related areas of law, scholarly criticism of the current law, or other authority suggesting that change is warranted. If you are going to file a pleading, motion, or other paper that argues for a change in the law, but don\u2019t want to risk Rule 11 sanctions, think of it this way: \u2018\u2018I\u2019m going out on a limb here. My position is contradicted by the cases. If the judge calls me in before the bench and asks why I should not be sanctioned for violating Rule 11(b)(2), what will I say?\u2019\u2019 You need to be ready with a credible explanation why your argument for change is justified by precedent or other authority. You might say, \u2018\u2018Yes, your honor, I know that I\u2019m arguing to overrule Flores v. Jones, the case on point from our state supreme court, but the Third Restatement of Torts now takes the position I advocate, and four states have recently adopted it.\u2019\u2019 Or, \u2018\u2018Yes, your Honor, I know our state supreme court ruled otherwise in 1934, but look at how many areas of tort law they have modified since. Recognizing this cause of action is supported by our court\u2019s consistent expansion of tort remedies for negligence, reflected in the following seven cases.\u2019\u2019 Arguments like those are \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous.\u2019\u2019 The advocate is not just saying, \u2018\u2018I think the law should be otherwise,\u2019\u2019 but pointing to legal authority that supports the argument. This is reasoned persuasive argument rather than stubborn refusal to face the music. Courts should not prevent that, and Rule 11(b) (2) does not either. Consider this question on the point.  Rule 11 also imposes constraints on the factual allegations made in a pleading or motion. Under Rule 11(b)(3), the party making factual allegations certifies that \u2018\u2018after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,\u2019\u2019 those allegations \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\u2019\u2019 The basic standard, that the factual contentions \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support,\u2019\u2019 mandates that counsel have looked into the facts and have credible evidence in support of each fact alleged in her court filings. This standard clearly does not require that the evidence available at the time of filing the paper clearly establishes the fact alleged, or even makes it more probable than not that the fact is true. It requires that counsel have looked into the matter, and after doing so has some preliminary evidence in support of the allegation. That\u2019s a pretty indulgent standard, yet it does bar the tempting practice of filing papers without evidence and then casting about to find some later down the line. That is a temptation to busy counsel that Rule 11(b)(3) is meant to discourage. Consider this example. To nail it, take a look at Rule 11(c)(1) as well as Rule 11(b). \n\nQuestion:\n7.

You might say, \u2018\u2018Yes, your honor, I know that I\u2019m arguing to overrule Flores v. Jones, the case on point from our state supreme court, but the Third Restatement of Torts now takes the position I advocate, and four states have recently adopted it.\u2019\u2019 Or, \u2018\u2018Yes, your Honor, I know our state supreme court ruled otherwise in 1934, but look at how many areas of tort law they have modified since. Recognizing this cause of action is supported by our court\u2019s consistent expansion of tort remedies for negligence, reflected in the following seven cases.\u2019\u2019 Arguments like those are \u2018\u2018nonfrivolous.\u2019\u2019 The advocate is not just saying, \u2018\u2018I think the law should be otherwise,\u2019\u2019 but pointing to legal authority that supports the argument. This is reasoned persuasive argument rather than stubborn refusal to face the music. Courts should not prevent that, and Rule 11(b) (2) does not either. Consider this question on the point.  Rule 11 also imposes constraints on the factual allegations made in a pleading or motion. Under Rule 11(b)(3), the party making factual allegations certifies that \u2018\u2018after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances,\u2019\u2019 those allegations \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, are likely to have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\u2019\u2019 The basic standard, that the factual contentions \u2018\u2018have evidentiary support,\u2019\u2019 mandates that counsel have looked into the facts and have credible evidence in support of each fact alleged in her court filings. This standard clearly does not require that the evidence available at the time of filing the paper clearly establishes the fact alleged, or even makes it more probable than not that the fact is true. It requires that counsel have looked into the matter, and after doing so has some preliminary evidence in support of the allegation. That\u2019s a pretty indulgent standard, yet it does bar the tempting practice of filing papers without evidence and then casting about to find some later down the line. That is a temptation to busy counsel that Rule 11(b)(3) is meant to discourage. Consider this example. To nail it, take a look at Rule 11(c)(1) as well as Rule 11(b). \n\nQuestion:\n7. Fudd-ging Rule 11. Which of the following orders of Judge Fudd would be authorized by Rule 11?\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nNorris, lawyer for the plaintiff, Conowitz, files a complaint seeking recovery on behalf of Conowitz for indirect infliction of emotional distress. Conowitz suffered severe emotional distress from witnessing a serious injury to a stranger. Recent decisions from the state\u2019s highest court clearly bar recovery for indirect infliction unless the direct victim of the accident was a family member. The defendant did not move for sanctions under Rule 11(c)(2). Judge Fudd, after a show cause hearing on the issue of whether Norris should be sanctioned, enters an order under Rule 11 ordering Norris to pay $1,000 to the court for wasting its time.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nMy students perennially confuse the special appearance with the objection to personal jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). That\u2019s understandable. In studying personal jurisdiction, we read common law cases in which the defendant \u2018\u2018appears specially\u2019\u2019 to object to jurisdiction. Then we study pleadings and motions under the Federal Rules, and along comes a different approach to jurisdictional objections. It\u2019s easy enough to mix them up. The special appearance was the common law\u2019s rather formalistic approach to raising objections to personal jurisdiction. A defendant who claimed that the court in which suit was filed lacked jurisdiction over her would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 to contest the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The defendant making a special appearance had to do so before answering the complaint on the merits, and she had to confine her argument to the lack of jurisdiction. If she raised any other issue, the court would hold that she had entered a \u2018\u2018general appearance\u2019\u2019 by litigating issues other than jurisdiction. Any reference to the merits, or even to other types of preliminary objections, could lead the court to conclude that, by appearing to litigate other issues, the defendant had submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and waived her objection to personal jurisdiction. In the federal courts, and in the many states that have modeled their procedural rules after the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, objections to personal jurisdiction are governed by Rule 12. The common law special appearance does not apply. But Rule 12 bears some resemblance to its common law ancestor. It still requires that the objection be asserted in the first response to the complaint, either a pre-answer motion or answer. And it still provides that the objection is waived if it isn\u2019t raised in a timely manner. The major difference, however, is that a defendant who moves to dismiss in federal court under Rule 12 for lack of jurisdiction may, in the same motion, assert other pre-answer defenses. She could, for example, move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to join an indispensable party. If she raised those two objections in a jurisdiction that adheres to the older special appearance approach, she would be deemed to waive her objection to personal jurisdiction by also raising an issue that is presumably only relevant if the court has jurisdiction.

For example, in Hickman, opposing counsel sought production of Fortenbaugh\u2019s recollections of his interviews with witnesses, as well as his notes of other interviews. Rule 26(b)(3) would not protect this information, since it is not a \u2018\u2018document or tangible thing.\u2019\u2019 It isn\u2019t clear why the rulemakers, in drafting Rule 26(b)(3), chose to address only work product objections to production of documents and tangible things.

However, this has not been the reading of the courts. Most courts have held that intangible work product continues to enjoy protection under standards established in the Hickman case itself. Thus, they need not be produced absent some showing of extraordinary need. See, e.g., Sporck v. Peil, 759 F.2d 312 (3d Cir. 1985).

A good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties\u2019 relative access to relevant information, the parties\u2019 resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of \u2018\u2018any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.\u2019\u2019 In an effort to rein in discovery, the \u2018\u2018relevant to the claim or defense of any party\u2019\u2019 language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to \u2018\u2018the subject matter of the pending action,\u2019\u2019 but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called \u2018\u2018proportionality factors\u2019\u2019 in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the \u2018\u2018relevant to a claim or defense in the action\u2019\u2019 standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff\u2019s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants\u2019 arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is discoverable even though it isn\u2019t admissible as evidence at a trial. \u2018\u2018Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\u2019\u2019 For example, statements that are \u2018\u2018hearsay,\u2019\u2019 that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here\u2019s a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).  Because the standard for relevance in Rule 26(b)(1), as amended in 2000, is tied to the claims and defenses in the case, the parties\u2019 pleadings play an important role in determining the scope of discovery.

Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties\u2019 relative access to relevant information, the parties\u2019 resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of \u2018\u2018any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.\u2019\u2019 In an effort to rein in discovery, the \u2018\u2018relevant to the claim or defense of any party\u2019\u2019 language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to \u2018\u2018the subject matter of the pending action,\u2019\u2019 but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called \u2018\u2018proportionality factors\u2019\u2019 in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the \u2018\u2018relevant to a claim or defense in the action\u2019\u2019 standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff\u2019s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants\u2019 arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is discoverable even though it isn\u2019t admissible as evidence at a trial. \u2018\u2018Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\u2019\u2019 For example, statements that are \u2018\u2018hearsay,\u2019\u2019 that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial. If Smith says he heard Jones say that Chen ran the red light, that statement is hearsay. Unless a hearsay exception applies, Smith cannot testify to that at trial, at least if Chen can be brought into court to testify himself. But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here\u2019s a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).  Because the standard for relevance in Rule 26(b)(1), as amended in 2000, is tied to the claims and defenses in the case, the parties\u2019 pleadings play an important role in determining the scope of discovery. By raising issues in the pleadings, the parties lay themselves open to discovery on issues which otherwise might remain free from inquiry. Prior to the amendment, the pleadings were less central to the scope of discovery, since any information relevant to \u2018\u2018the subject matter of the action,\u2019\u2019 rather than the \u2018\u2018claims or defenses\u2019\u2019 raised by the parties was subject to discovery. In the following question, consider whether the information sought is relevant to the claims and defenses of the parties.    \n\nQuestion:\n8. Exceeding the limits?

DeMarco, Sorenson\u2019s counsel, takes the deposition of Sanchez, an independent accountant who audited Marathon\u2019s business, and had been involved in the negotiations and planning for the acquisition. At the outset of the deposition, DeMarco asks Sanchez whether the company\u2019s lawyers, in preparing him for his deposition, had noted any particularly problematic issues they expected to come up at the deposition, and what areas of inquiry they had spent most of their time discussing.

For example, in Hickman, opposing counsel sought production of Fortenbaugh\u2019s recollections of his interviews with witnesses, as well as his notes of other interviews. Rule 26(b)(3) would not protect this information, since it is not a \u2018\u2018document or tangible thing.\u2019\u2019 It isn\u2019t clear why the rulemakers, in drafting Rule 26(b)(3), chose to address only work product objections to production of documents and tangible things. It might be argued that, since they chose to protect these from disclosure (unless the appropriate showing is made), by implication, other work product\u2014that is, intangible work product like Fortenbaugh\u2019s recollections of witness interviews\u2014are not protected. However, this has not been the reading of the courts. Most courts have held that intangible work product continues to enjoy protection under standards established in the Hickman case itself. Thus, they need not be produced absent some showing of extraordinary need. See, e.g., Sporck v. Peil, 759 F.2d 312 (3d Cir. 1985).

Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This \u2018\u2018aggregation\u2019\u2019 problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot \u2018\u2018aggregate\u2019\u2019 claims against different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a \u2018\u2018common, undivided interest.\u2019\u2019 (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at Chapter 14, pp. 279-283. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.  Frequently, a plaintiff sues two or more defendants on a tort claim for injuries arguably worth more than $75,000. Suppose, for example, that Epstein suffers nerve damage during surgery, and that the damages are $90,000. He sues Dr. Smith and Dr. Doe for his injury, claiming that the negligence of each during the operation contributed to the injury. Does he satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement against the doctors? Under the law of damages in tort cases, he does, because either of the doctors might be held liable for the entire injury. Suppose that the jury finds that the injury was Smith\u2019s fault alone. It would return a verdict against Smith for $90,000. So, Smith might be liable for more than the jurisdictional amount. Alternatively, if the jury found that the injury was Doe\u2019s fault alone, it would return a $90,000 verdict against Doe. So he also might be liable for the jurisdictional amount. Thus, the court cannot say to a legal certainty that Epstein could not recover the required amount from Smith, or from Doe. The amount requirement is met against either. Suppose the jury found that they were both negligent and contributed to the harm? On this assumption, the result turns on the tort law of the state. In some states, they would find Smith and Doe \u2018\u2018jointly and severally liable\u2019\u2019 for $90,000, which means that each would be held liable for the full amount, and Epstein could collect $90,000 from either.3 In other states, they would each be held liable for parts of the loss, based on their percentages of negligence. But the amount requirement would be met in either type of jurisdiction. As long as either defendant might be held liable for the full $90,000, that amount is \u2018\u2018in controversy\u2019\u2019 between her and the plaintiff. Since either Smith or Doe might be found solely at fault, either might be held liable for the full $90,000. To illustrate: \n\nQuestion:\n11. Stooges do the math.

If a party is living in a state without definite plans to leave, the domicile test regards that state as her \u2018\u2018home.\u2019\u2019 She is there, not as a visitor, but as a citizen. She is, psychologically speaking, at home there, rather than passing through. She may choose to move on, as we all may, but at the moment she has no plans to do so. Remember that, until the two prongs coincide in a new state, your old domicile continues, whether you plan to return to that state or not. If Acari, from Hawaii, leaves for a one-year job acting in a play in California, planning to go to New York afterwards, he remains domiciled in Hawaii, even if he swears that he will never return to Hawaii. He hasn\u2019t acquired a domicile in California, because he doesn\u2019t plan to stay there indefinitely. He hasn\u2019t acquired one in New York either, since he doesn\u2019t reside there yet. Domicile doctrine abhors a vacuum, so it holds that Acari keeps his Hawaii domicile until the two prerequisites come together in another state. In analyzing the question below, assume that the court applies the reside-with-intent-to-remain-indefinitely test, and consider where Marla has established a residence with the requisite \u2018\u2018indefinite\u2019\u2019 intent. \n\nQuestion:\n12. Flaky Filbert. Filbert is flaky. He moved to Nebraska from Chicago, Illinois, to go to law school, planning to return to Chicago after law school to practice law. After his first year, he did a summer clerkship at a Denver, Colorado, law firm. They liked his work and indicated that they would hire him after graduation. Filbert decided he would go back to the firm after graduation. During his second year, he received a letter from the firm indicating that they would probably not have an opening for him after graduation. Consequently, he clerked in an Omaha, Nebraska, firm after his second year, and accepted an offer to join the firm after graduation. In the middle of his third year, the Denver firm called him up and made him an offer. The offer was too good to resist, so he decided to renege on the Omaha job and go to Denver when he finished school. Immediately after the events described,\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nFilbert is domiciled in Nebraska, because he lives there now and has no plans to return to Illinois.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nA deposition is the examination of a witness under oath. Depositions are the most effective means of previewing the detailed testimony of witnesses. The party wishing to depose the witness sends a notice of the deposition to the deponent and to all other parties. If the deponent is not a party, a subpoena must also be sent to ensure the witness\u2019s attendance. The subpoena is a court order to appear and give testimony. A witness who ignores it may be punished by the court. (Parties do not have to be subpoenaed, because they are already before the court and subject to the rules of discovery and to court orders enforcing them.) Depositions serve several purposes. They \u2018\u2018get the witness on the record.\u2019\u2019 That is, the witness tells her story under oath. If she contradicts that story at trial, she can be impeached with her deposition testimony. Depositions also allow deposing counsel to learn what the witness knows and to ask follow-up questions to get the details of what the witness knows. In addition, taking a witness\u2019s deposition gives opposing counsel the opportunity to look the witness in the eye, to form a judgment about her credibility and about how she will likely perform as a witness at trial. Ordinarily, parties will depose the other side\u2019s witnesses rather than their own. After all, they can talk to their own witnesses privately, without revealing the witness\u2019s testimony or counsel\u2019s line of reasoning by the questions they ask. For the same reason, counsel do not usually cross-examine in detail at a deposition, except to clarify points on which the deponent\u2019s testimony may create a misimpression. However, in some cases a party may depose a witness in order to obtain the party\u2019s testimony for use at trial. If, for example, a witness is moving out of the country, the party who wants to use that witness\u2019s testimony at trial may take her deposition as a substitute for her live testimony at the trial. The deposition will be admissible at trial if the witness is not available to testify in person. Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(a)(4). Note that in this scenario, unlike the typical deposition, the party noticing the deposition will be the party who plans to use that witness\u2019s testimony, not the opposing party. Consider what the plaintiff\u2019s counsel should do in the following scenario.\n\nQuestion:\n9. Your witness. Czonka is fired from his job at fifty-nine, after twenty-one years with NorthStar Corporation. He sues in federal court under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), claiming that he was fired based on his age. Two months after filing suit, Czonka\u2019s counsel learns that Roh, one of his supervisors at NorthStar, has just retired, and is about to move to South Korea. Although discovery has just begun, NorthStar has noticed Roh\u2019s deposition. Czonka\u2019s counsel should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nobject on the ground that Roh cannot be deposed, since Roh is not a party to the case.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nWhile depositions produce sworn testimony, they are not taken in front of a judge. They are usually taken in the office of the lawyer taking the deposition. A court reporter, hired privately by deposing counsel, swears the witness and records the testimony. The testimony is then transcribed and provided to counsel for each party. Counsel for all parties are entitled to attend the deposition, and usually do. An interesting problem arises if the deponent\u2019s lawyer has objections to the deposing counsel\u2019s questions. Since there\u2019s no judge present to rule on objections, what happens? Several provisions of Rule 30 address this problem. Rule 30(c)(2) provides: An objection at the time of the examination\u2014whether to evidence, to a party\u2019s conduct, to the officer\u2019s qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition\u2014must be noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection. That rule further provides that \u2018\u2018A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the court, or to present a motion under Rule 30(d) (3).\u2019\u2019 Rule 30(d)(3)(A) authorizes a party to seek a protective order from the court if the deposition is being conducted \u2018\u2018in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party.\u2019\u2019 Under these provisions, the deponent\u2019s counsel may raise objections to the questions asked, but the deponent must usually answer despite the objection. For example, if the witness is asked a question her counsel considers irrelevant to the issues in the case, her counsel may object, but the witness should still answer the question (\u2018\u2018the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection\u2019\u2019\u2014Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(c)(2)). This approach generally makes sense: most objections are meant to protect against the use of evidence at trial, not against providing the testimony per se. Since most deposition testimony is never used at trial, most of the objections raised to the testimony will never have to be resolved. If the disputed deposition testimony is offered at trial, the judge can rule on the objections when it is offered in evidence. So, the questioning at the deposition is fairly unconstrained.

But in many cases there is no jury; the judge not only administers the trial, but also hears the evidence and finds the facts. Judges act as the fact finder where neither party requests a jury, and in many cases in which the parties do not have a right to jury trial. How do motions for judgment as a matter of law work in a judge- tried case, where the judge is finding the facts? How does she apply the concepts covered in this chapter, particularly the burden of production and the burden of proof? The short answer is that Federal Rules 50(a) and (b) don\u2019t apply at all in a judge-tried case. See the heading of the rule, \u2018\u2018Judgment as a Matter of Law in a Jury Trial.\u2019\u2019 And there\u2019s a good reason for this. These motions exist to prevent the jury from deciding for a party on the basis of insufficient evidence. The judge doesn\u2019t have to constrain herself from doing that, where she is the fact finder. If the judge thinks the plaintiff\u2019s evidence is too weak to support a verdict for her, she can simply rule that the plaintiff hasn\u2019t proved her case!

First, they will decide such questions when plaintiffs file cases arising under federal law in state court, if the defendant doesn\u2019t remove to federal court. Second, they will decide federal questions when the plaintiff sues in state court on state law claims, and the defendant relies on federal law as a defense, as the defendant did in Mottley. And third, they will decide federal issues when the plaintiff sues in state court and the defendant asserts a counterclaim arising under federal law. In all these situations, the courts of the fifty states will be deciding issues of federal law. Naturally, different courts in different states may decide the same issue differently. One state may decide that a claimant must show intent to discriminate under the ADEA, while another may interpret it to bar practices that have a disparate impact on older employees, even if no intent is shown. Suppose one state court holds that the federal statute in Mottley bars renewal of passes, but the courts of another state hold that it doesn\u2019t? There has to be some court at the top of the system to reconcile such conflicting holdings, to rule definitively on the meaning of federal law. And that court ought to be a federal court: otherwise the states could undermine federal authority by unsympathetic interpretation or application of federal law. Under our constitutional system, the obvious candidate for this role is the United States Supreme Court. And, under Osborn, the Court itself has held that it has the authority to fulfill that role, even in cases involving federal defenses or counterclaims, since federal law is \u2018\u2018an ingredient\u2019\u2019 in such cases. But, of course, it would be severely hampered in fulfilling that role if its power to exercise judicial review were limited by the Mottley rule, if it could only review cases in which the plaintiff asserts a claim arising under federal law. However, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, to which the Mottley rule applies, does not address the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court. It addresses the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts, the trial courts of the federal system. The statute that governs the Supreme Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71257, is a great deal broader than \u00a71331. 28 U.S.C. \u00a71257. State courts; certiorari (a) Final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari where the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in question or where the validity of a statute of any State is drawn in question on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, or where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution or the treaties or statutes of, or any commission held or authority exercised under, the United States. This statute authorizes the Supreme Court to review cases that come up to it through the court systems of the states. It allows review of cases in which federal issues are raised\u2014by defendants as well as plaintiffs. Suppose, for example, that a town sued a defendant for violating a state adult bookstore zoning statute, and the store owner claimed the statute was unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. This case could not be brought in federal court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, as interpreted in Mottley, since it arises under a state zoning statute. But the state court\u2019s decision upholding or invalidating the statute could be reviewed by the Supreme Court under \u00a71257, since it involves a claim (by the defendant) that the state statute is \u2018\u2018repugnant to the Constitution.\u2019\u2019 Consider this example, which analyzes the scope of review in the United States Supreme Court of state court cases posing federal issues.  Thus, with arising-under cases as with diversity cases, it is always necessary to analyze the constitutional scope of jurisdiction and Congress\u2019s grant of that jurisdiction separately. In arising-under cases, as in diversity cases, Congress has never chosen to authorize the federal district courts to exercise all of the Article III jurisdiction. Here\u2019s another example to drive home the point.  Article III, \u00a72 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases \u2018\u2018arising under\u2019\u2019 federal law. And 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, the statute conveying arising-under jurisdiction to the federal district courts, uses the same language. A student, or a lawyer, might reasonably conclude that this language means the same thing in the statute and in the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase \u2018\u2018arising under federal law\u2019\u2019 in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, shouldn\u2019t that phrase mean the same thing in Article III, \u00a72? Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. If the Mottley rule were an interpretation of Article III, it would drastically restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases that involve federal defenses and counterclaims. For example, the Court would have no power to hear an appeal in a case like Consolidated\u2019s in Question 1, which raises a federal issue, but does not satisfy the Mottley test. The state courts would then have the final authority to decide the federal law questions raised by the case. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of the Article III arising-under jurisdiction much more broadly than Mottley\u2019s construction of the arising-under statute. In Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. 738 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of the case. Certainly, federal law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of a case if a federal issue is raised as a defense or as a counterclaim. Thus, because the Article III grant extends to such cases, Congress could do away with the Mottley rule (what law student would miss it?) by amending 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. Although this has been clear since Osborn, Congress has never repudiated Mottley, because it provides a clear rule that allows federal courts to determine their jurisdiction at the outset of the case, and limits the potential for parties to manipulate federal jurisdiction. To illustrate the distinction between the reach of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III and under \u00a71331, consider the following question.    \n\nQuestion:\n11. A Mottley reprise. Erasmus L. and Annie E. Mottley sue the Louisville and Nashville R.R. Co. for refusing to renew the free passes it had contracted to provide the Mottleys for life. They sue in state court. The railroad claims that a federal statute making free passes illegal bars renewal of the passes, even though they were contracted for before the statute was enacted. The Mottleys claim that the statute should not be interpreted to apply to passes previously granted, and that, if it does apply to such passes, it deprives them of property (their right to the passes) without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court holds (1) that the statute bars renewal of the Mottleys\u2019 passes, and (2) that the statute creates an unconstitutional taking of the Mottleys\u2019 property. Consequently, the court holds the statute unconstitutional as applied to them, and orders the passes renewed. The state supreme court affirms. The railroad seeks review in the United States Supreme Court. The Court\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ndoes not have the authority under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71257 to review either holding by the state court, because the Mottleys\u2019 case arises under state contract law.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nThe preceding sections make clear that state courts are going to decide many questions of federal law. First, they will decide such questions when plaintiffs file cases arising under federal law in state court, if the defendant doesn\u2019t remove to federal court. Second, they will decide federal questions when the plaintiff sues in state court on state law claims, and the defendant relies on federal law as a defense, as the defendant did in Mottley. And third, they will decide federal issues when the plaintiff sues in state court and the defendant asserts a counterclaim arising under federal law. In all these situations, the courts of the fifty states will be deciding issues of federal law. Naturally, different courts in different states may decide the same issue differently. One state may decide that a claimant must show intent to discriminate under the ADEA, while another may interpret it to bar practices that have a disparate impact on older employees, even if no intent is shown. Suppose one state court holds that the federal statute in Mottley bars renewal of passes, but the courts of another state hold that it doesn\u2019t? There has to be some court at the top of the system to reconcile such conflicting holdings, to rule definitively on the meaning of federal law. And that court ought to be a federal court: otherwise the states could undermine federal authority by unsympathetic interpretation or application of federal law. Under our constitutional system, the obvious candidate for this role is the United States Supreme Court. And, under Osborn, the Court itself has held that it has the authority to fulfill that role, even in cases involving federal defenses or counterclaims, since federal law is \u2018\u2018an ingredient\u2019\u2019 in such cases. But, of course, it would be severely hampered in fulfilling that role if its power to exercise judicial review were limited by the Mottley rule, if it could only review cases in which the plaintiff asserts a claim arising under federal law. However, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, to which the Mottley rule applies, does not address the appellate jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court. It addresses the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts, the trial courts of the federal system. The statute that governs the Supreme Court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71257, is a great deal broader than \u00a71331. 28 U.S.C. \u00a71257. State courts; certiorari (a) Final judgments or decrees rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision could be had, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari where the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States is drawn in question or where the validity of a statute of any State is drawn in question on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, or where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution or the treaties or statutes of, or any commission held or authority exercised under, the United States. This statute authorizes the Supreme Court to review cases that come up to it through the court systems of the states. It allows review of cases in which federal issues are raised\u2014by defendants as well as plaintiffs. Suppose, for example, that a town sued a defendant for violating a state adult bookstore zoning statute, and the store owner claimed the statute was unconstitutional under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. This case could not be brought in federal court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, as interpreted in Mottley, since it arises under a state zoning statute. But the state court\u2019s decision upholding or invalidating the statute could be reviewed by the Supreme Court under \u00a71257, since it involves a claim (by the defendant) that the state statute is \u2018\u2018repugnant to the Constitution.\u2019\u2019 Consider this example, which analyzes the scope of review in the United States Supreme Court of state court cases posing federal issues.  Thus, with arising-under cases as with diversity cases, it is always necessary to analyze the constitutional scope of jurisdiction and Congress\u2019s grant of that jurisdiction separately. In arising-under cases, as in diversity cases, Congress has never chosen to authorize the federal district courts to exercise all of the Article III jurisdiction. Here\u2019s another example to drive home the point.  Article III, \u00a72 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases \u2018\u2018arising under\u2019\u2019 federal law. And 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, the statute conveying arising-under jurisdiction to the federal district courts, uses the same language. A student, or a lawyer, might reasonably conclude that this language means the same thing in the statute and in the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase \u2018\u2018arising under federal law\u2019\u2019 in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, shouldn\u2019t that phrase mean the same thing in Article III, \u00a72? Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. If the Mottley rule were an interpretation of Article III, it would drastically restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases that involve federal defenses and counterclaims. For example, the Court would have no power to hear an appeal in a case like Consolidated\u2019s in Question 1, which raises a federal issue, but does not satisfy the Mottley test. The state courts would then have the final authority to decide the federal law questions raised by the case.

Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. 738 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of the case. Certainly, federal law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of a case if a federal issue is raised as a defense or as a counterclaim. Thus, because the Article III grant extends to such cases, Congress could do away with the Mottley rule (what law student would miss it?) by amending 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. Although this has been clear since Osborn, Congress has never repudiated Mottley, because it provides a clear rule that allows federal courts to determine their jurisdiction at the outset of the case, and limits the potential for parties to manipulate federal jurisdiction. To illustrate the distinction between the reach of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III and under \u00a71331, consider the following question.    \n\nQuestion:\n11. A Mottley reprise. Erasmus L. and Annie E. Mottley sue the Louisville and Nashville R.R. Co. for refusing to renew the free passes it had contracted to provide the Mottleys for life. They sue in state court. The railroad claims that a federal statute making free passes illegal bars renewal of the passes, even though they were contracted for before the statute was enacted. The Mottleys claim that the statute should not be interpreted to apply to passes previously granted, and that, if it does apply to such passes, it deprives them of property (their right to the passes) without due process of law under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The court holds (1) that the statute bars renewal of the Mottleys\u2019 passes, and (2) that the statute creates an unconstitutional taking of the Mottleys\u2019 property. Consequently, the court holds the statute unconstitutional as applied to them, and orders the passes renewed. The state supreme court affirms. The railroad seeks review in the United States Supreme Court. The Court\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe Mottleys\u2019 names can\u2019t possibly be Erasmus and Annie.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nThe removal statute provides that \u2018\u2018all defendants who have been properly joined and served as defendants must join in or consent to the removal.\u2019\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a71446(b)(2)(a). If Akila sues Redstone and Cianci in state court on a federal claim, and Redstone wants to be in federal court, but Cianci doesn\u2019t, the case cannot be removed. Well, that\u2019s not quite true. Redstone could file a notice of removal, but if Cianci wants the state forum, he would then move to remand to the state court on the ground that he did not agree to removal. And that motion would be granted. If the defendants don\u2019t agree to federal court, the case will stay in state court. If a case is removable, it must be removed within thirty days. 28 U.S.C. \u00a71446(a). But there\u2019s another thirty-day rule in the removal statutes, and it\u2019s trickier than the first. Section 1447(c) provides in part: \u2018\u2018A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the notice of removal under section 1446(a).\u2019\u2019 This section requires that, if any party has an objection to removal, other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction, she must raise it within thirty days after removal, or the objection is waived. For example, if the plaintiff claimed the case wasn\u2019t removed within thirty days, she could seek remand on this ground, but only within thirty days after removal. The rationale for this short window for most motions to remand is the same as the rationale for the first thirty-day period for removing the case: Both courts need to know where the case is going to be litigated. The section seeks to avoid belated procedural objections from disgruntled litigants that would disrupt the litigation. This question illustrates the operation of \u00a71447(c)\u2019s waiver provision.\n\nQuestion:\n9. Removal malpractice. Tyrgyz, from New Jersey, sues Dr. Boch, from Maryland and Dr. Ivens, from Delaware in state court in New Jersey, for negligence in an operation. He seeks $120,000 (a supportable amount) in damages, claiming that either Boch or Ivens was the cause of his injuries. Ivens answers the complaint ten days later. Boch files a notice of removal to federal court ten days after Ivens answers. Two months later, Ivens moves to remand the case to state court on the ground that he did not agree to removal. The motion should be\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ndenied, because removal was proper, since the case is within the federal diversity jurisdiction.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\nHere\u2019s a challenging Closer that involves removal under \u00a71441(a), supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367(a), and the \u00a71441(b)(2) limit on removal of diversity cases. Good luck!  The basic standard for removal jurisdiction is simple and sensible: a defendant sued in state court may remove a case to federal court if it could have been filed originally in federal court. The rationale for removal is to give both parties access to federal court for cases within the federal court\u2019s jurisdiction. So it makes sense that the standard for removing a case to federal court should mirror the standard for filing one in federal court to begin with. So, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71441(a) provides that \u2018\u2018any civil action brought in a State court of which the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 may be removed to federal court. Consequently, the first question to ask in analyzing a removal problem is whether the claim asserted by the plaintiff fits into some category of federal jurisdiction. Is it a diversity case, or an arising-under case? A case between a citizen and foreign citizen, or some other case provided for in Article III, \u00a72? If not, it can\u2019t be removed. If it is, then, with a few minor exceptions, it can be. Here\u2019s a first example to illustrate this relation between original and removal jurisdiction.  While it is generally true that a case that could have been filed in federal court can be removed there, it is not always true. The removal statute provides that a diversity case cannot be removed if there is an in-state defendant: \u00a71441(b)(2). A civil action removable solely on the basis of the jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought. This is a sensible limit on removal, given the rationale for federal diversity jurisdiction. The logic for allowing diversity cases to be brought in federal court is the risk of prejudice in the state court; but if a defendant is sued in her home state, she is not at risk of prejudice. If Coretta, from Wisconsin, sues Parkins, from Iowa, in an Iowa state court, there is little reason to allow Parkins to remove. Any prejudice in the state court would be in favor of Parkins, so why allow her to bump the case into federal court? Section 1441 (b)(2) therefore bars her from doing so.

Appropriately understood, it means that the court will construe the specific provisions of its long-arm statute as broadly as possible without overreaching constitutional bounds. If language in the statute might be interpreted one way to support jurisdiction, and another to deny it, the court will opt for the broadest interpretation consistent  No verbiage is more common in personal jurisdiction cases than the shibboleth that \u2018\u2018our long-arm statute goes to the limits of due process.\u2019\u2019 But what does this verbiage mean? It would seem to mean, \u2018\u2018in our state, if it would be constitutional to exercise jurisdiction, the long-arm statute authorizes the court to do so.\u2019\u2019 Or, put another way, that the scope of jurisdiction under the statute is the same as the scope of the court\u2019s constitutional reach under the Due Process Clause. In some states, this is true. California, for example, has a simple long-arm statute, which provides that its courts can exercise jurisdiction \u2018\u2018on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution of this state or of the United States.\u2019\u2019 Cal. Civ. Proc. Code \u00a7410.10. Here, the statute really does \u2018\u2018go to the limits of due process,\u2019\u2019 in that it authorizes all jurisdiction that is constitutionally permissible.

The natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she\u2019s been sued in the wrong court is to protest. You\u2019d feel the same way. \u2018\u2018Hey, wait! This case doesn\u2019t belong here; throw it out.\u2019\u2019 All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court\u2019s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019 The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have \u2018\u2018appeared generally,\u2019\u2019 waiving her special appearance and accepting the court\u2019s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \u2018\u2018special appearance\u2019\u2019 had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\u2019s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\u2019s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here\u2019s a question to test the point. I\u2019ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you\u2019ve read the discussion above it should be easy.  A defendant sued away from home has another option if she believes that the court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. She may ignore the suit entirely. Suppose that Ito, sued by Ervin in Emporia, never moves to dismiss, never appears specially, simply ignores the law suit. What will happen? The court will very likely assume that Ito has no defense to the claim, and enter a default judgment for Ervin on the claim. But who cares? If Ito has no property in Emporia, and no plans to go there personally, Ervin won\u2019t be able to collect the judgment there. He will have to come to Ito\u2019s state to enforce the judgment. This is often done by bringing an action for a \u2018\u2018judgment on the judgment\u2019\u2019 in the enforcing state, to convert the Emporia judgment into a judgment of the enforcing state. Once Ervin obtains such a judgment in the state where he seeks to enforce the judgment, he can invoke its judgment-collection procedures to collect the judgment from Ito. Suppose, for example, that Ito lives in the state of Acadia, and has property there that could be sold to satisfy Ervin\u2019s judgment. An Acadia court would not order \u2018\u2018execution\u2019\u2019 on an Emporia judgment, that is, the use of its court procedures to collect the Emporia judgment from Ito\u2019s assets. Acadia courts only enforce Acadia judgments. So, Ervin would have to bring a suit in the courts of Acadia, asking the court to enter an Acadia judgment on the Emporia judgment. This is a new law suit; Ervin\u2019s the plaintiff, Ito\u2019s the defendant. Ito will be served with process in the enforcement action and have an opportunity to raise any defenses he may have. States generally have to honor each other\u2019s judgments, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. Acadia would be bound, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, to recognize the Emporia judgment by entering an Acadia judgment recognizing it. Once that has been done, Ervin has an Acadia judgment against an Acadia defendant, and can use local court procedures to have Ito\u2019s assets sold to satisfy his judgment.1 However, states do not automatically honor all judgments of other states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. A defendant in Ito\u2019s position can raise certain narrow defenses to enforcing the Emporia judgment . . . including the defense that the court that rendered the judgment lacked the power to do so. Even before Pennoyer v. Neff, courts allowed judgment debtors to resist enforcement of judgments on the ground that the court that rendered the judgment lacked personal jurisdiction. In the earlier cases, it was supposed that the [full faith and credit] act gave to all judgments the same effect in other States which they had by law in the State where rendered. But this view was afterwards qualified so as to make the act applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject- matter, and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 729 (1877). So, Ervin may bring his Emporia judgment to Acadia to enforce, and Ito may try to convince the court not to enforce it because the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. In light of this black letter law, consider the following question.  \n\nQuestion:\n8. Impersonal jurisdiction. Ervin sues Ito, from Acadia, for fraud in a sale of stock. He brings the action in an Emporia court. Ito defends the case on the merits and loses; the case ends in a judgment for Ervin for $50,000. Ervin now brings suit in New Mexico, where Ito (who lives in Acadia) owns a valuable two-week time share at a resort. Ervin seeks a judgment on the Emporia judgment, so that he can obtain a New Mexico court order for sale of the time share to satisfy his judgment. Ito appears and objects to the New Mexico court exercising personal jurisdiction over him for Ervin\u2019s claim. He argues that he has no minimum contacts with New Mexico that gave rise to this claim, and that he is not subject to general in personam jurisdiction in New Mexico based on owning a time share there. If the judge agrees that the New Mexico court has no basis to exercise personal jurisdiction over Ito for Ervin\u2019s underlying fraud claim, she will likely\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ndismiss the enforcement action.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\n Closers are designed to be tough.

This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here\u2019s a question to test the point. I\u2019ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you\u2019ve read the discussion above it should be easy.  A defendant sued away from home has another option if she believes that the court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim. She may ignore the suit entirely. Suppose that Ito, sued by Ervin in Emporia, never moves to dismiss, never appears specially, simply ignores the law suit. What will happen? The court will very likely assume that Ito has no defense to the claim, and enter a default judgment for Ervin on the claim. But who cares? If Ito has no property in Emporia, and no plans to go there personally, Ervin won\u2019t be able to collect the judgment there. He will have to come to Ito\u2019s state to enforce the judgment. This is often done by bringing an action for a \u2018\u2018judgment on the judgment\u2019\u2019 in the enforcing state, to convert the Emporia judgment into a judgment of the enforcing state. Once Ervin obtains such a judgment in the state where he seeks to enforce the judgment, he can invoke its judgment-collection procedures to collect the judgment from Ito. Suppose, for example, that Ito lives in the state of Acadia, and has property there that could be sold to satisfy Ervin\u2019s judgment. An Acadia court would not order \u2018\u2018execution\u2019\u2019 on an Emporia judgment, that is, the use of its court procedures to collect the Emporia judgment from Ito\u2019s assets. Acadia courts only enforce Acadia judgments. So, Ervin would have to bring a suit in the courts of Acadia, asking the court to enter an Acadia judgment on the Emporia judgment. This is a new law suit; Ervin\u2019s the plaintiff, Ito\u2019s the defendant. Ito will be served with process in the enforcement action and have an opportunity to raise any defenses he may have. States generally have to honor each other\u2019s judgments, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. Acadia would be bound, under the Full Faith and Credit Clause, to recognize the Emporia judgment by entering an Acadia judgment recognizing it. Once that has been done, Ervin has an Acadia judgment against an Acadia defendant, and can use local court procedures to have Ito\u2019s assets sold to satisfy his judgment.1 However, states do not automatically honor all judgments of other states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. A defendant in Ito\u2019s position can raise certain narrow defenses to enforcing the Emporia judgment . . . including the defense that the court that rendered the judgment lacked the power to do so. Even before Pennoyer v. Neff, courts allowed judgment debtors to resist enforcement of judgments on the ground that the court that rendered the judgment lacked personal jurisdiction. In the earlier cases, it was supposed that the [full faith and credit] act gave to all judgments the same effect in other States which they had by law in the State where rendered. But this view was afterwards qualified so as to make the act applicable only when the court rendering the judgment had jurisdiction of the parties and of the subject- matter, and not to preclude an inquiry into the jurisdiction of the court in which the judgment was rendered, or the right of the State itself to exercise authority over the person or the subject-matter. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 729 (1877). So, Ervin may bring his Emporia judgment to Acadia to enforce, and Ito may try to convince the court not to enforce it because the Emporia court lacked personal jurisdiction over him. In light of this black letter law, consider the following question.  \n\nQuestion:\n8. Impersonal jurisdiction. Ervin sues Ito, from Acadia, for fraud in a sale of stock. He brings the action in an Emporia court. Ito defends the case on the merits and loses; the case ends in a judgment for Ervin for $50,000. Ervin now brings suit in New Mexico, where Ito (who lives in Acadia) owns a valuable two-week time share at a resort. Ervin seeks a judgment on the Emporia judgment, so that he can obtain a New Mexico court order for sale of the time share to satisfy his judgment. Ito appears and objects to the New Mexico court exercising personal jurisdiction over him for Ervin\u2019s claim. He argues that he has no minimum contacts with New Mexico that gave rise to this claim, and that he is not subject to general in personam jurisdiction in New Mexico based on owning a time share there. If the judge agrees that the New Mexico court has no basis to exercise personal jurisdiction over Ito for Ervin\u2019s underlying fraud claim, she will likely\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nattach the time share, and require Ervin to bring an action on the judgment in Acadia (where Ito is subject to personal jurisdiction based on domicile) ordering its sale to satisfy the Emporia judgment.\n\nAnalysis:", "Introduction:\n Closers are designed to be tough. So a \u2018\u2018Killer Closer\u2019\u2019 should be even worse. Closers are optional. You have no one to blame but yourself.  The natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she\u2019s been sued in the wrong court is to protest. You\u2019d feel the same way. \u2018\u2018Hey, wait! This case doesn\u2019t belong here; throw it out.\u2019\u2019 All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court\u2019s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019 The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have \u2018\u2018appeared generally,\u2019\u2019 waiving her special appearance and accepting the court\u2019s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \u2018\u2018special appearance\u2019\u2019 had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\u2019s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\u2019s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system.

First, let\u2019s deal with D. It is true that there is not complete diversity among the parties, since Antril and Acme are both from Florida. But diversity is irrelevant to Antril\u2019s claim against Acme. Antril sued Acme on a claim arising under federal law, so the citizenship of these parties is irrelevant. Leaving aside supplemental jurisdiction (as I asked you to do), Antril\u2019s claim against Manello is a state law negligence claim, so it may only be brought in federal court based on diversity. But Antril and Manello are diverse and we can ignore the citizenship of Acme, since Antril sued it on a different jurisdictional basis, a federal question claim. Just to make this point clear, imagine that Antril had sued Manello and Acme in two separate actions. If so, the federal court would have jurisdiction over the case against Manello based on diversity, and jurisdiction over the case against Acme based on arising-under jurisdiction. If she can do this (and she could) there is no reason why she can\u2019t sue them together, and base jurisdiction over the two claims on two separate grounds. Since the only parties to the claim based on diversity are Antril and Manello, diversity jurisdiction is proper over that claim. The fact that Acme is from Florida is irrelevant, since the claim against it is based on arising-under jurisdiction. Its citizenship thus does not defeat diversity jurisdiction over Antril\u2019s claim against Manello. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nIn litigation, there is many a slip between cup and lip.

Second, it alleges that Amalgamated agreed to allow Sempco to use the switch in their transformers if Sempco would not challenge the validity of Amalgamated\u2019s patent on it. The case is tried to a jury, which renders a general verdict for Amalgamated and awards damages to it. Two years later, Amalgamated sues Sempco again, this time alleging that it is using the same switch in making circuit boards for lighting systems.

Sometimes, a plaintiff may allege facts that would support a federal claim, but it is far from clear that she will be able to establish those facts. Here\u2019s a question that considers the relationship of such factual disputes to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. In addressing it, ignore the possibility of supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367.\n\nQuestion:\n8. Polymolysorbate. Antril, a Florida citizen, sues Manello, from Kentucky, in federal court. She claims that Manello, a driver for Acme Disposal Corporation, negligently drove a hazardous waste truck off the road, leading to a spill that polluted Antril\u2019s property with polymolysorbate. She also asserts a claim, in the same action, against Acme, a Florida corporation, for violation of the Federal Toxics Transportation Act (FTTA). That statute bars transporting polymolysorbate in a truck that lacks a secondary containment system, and allows recovery for resulting pollution damages. Antril\u2019s damages are, quite probably, several hundred thousand dollars. Manello answers the complaint denying that he drove negligently. In its answer, Acme admits that the Federal Toxics Transportation Act requires secondary containment for polymolysorbate, but denies that the polymolysorbate spilled from its truck. It alleges that its truck was not carrying polymolysorbate, so it must have come from an earlier spill by a different hauler.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe federal district has jurisdiction over the entire action.\n\nAnalysis:\nA, after all, is right. The federal district court has jurisdiction over the entire case. It has jurisdiction over Antril\u2019s claim against Manello based on diversity, and her claim against Acme because it seeks relief under federal law.2\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nA similar estoppel problem arises where a plaintiff brings suit, and the defendant asserts multiple defenses to the claim. Here again, we can only apply estoppel in a later action if we can figure out, from the pleadings, the trial and the verdict in the first action, what was decided in that action. Consider this case.\n\nQuestion:\n7. Switching switches. Amalgamated Manufacturing Company sues Sempco Products Company for patent infringement, claiming that it has been using a switch component in its electrical transformers that is identical to one on which Amalgamated holds a patent. Sempco defends on two grounds. First, Sempco alleges that Amalgamated\u2019s patent is invalid. Second, it alleges that Amalgamated agreed to allow Sempco to use the switch in their transformers if Sempco would not challenge the validity of Amalgamated\u2019s patent on it. The case is tried to a jury, which renders a general verdict for Amalgamated and awards damages to it. Two years later, Amalgamated sues Sempco again, this time alleging that it is using the same switch in making circuit boards for lighting systems. Sempco raises the defense that Amalgamated\u2019s patent on the switch is invalid. Amalgamated argues that Sempco is estopped from proving that the patent is invalid, since Sempco lost the prior action involving the same issue.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nSempco will not be estopped from proving that Amalgamated\u2019s patent is invalid, since it is not clear whether that issue was decided in the prior action.\n\nAnalysis:\nC is wrong, since we can tell that the issue was decided. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nGuaranty Trust Co. v.

Indeed, the Court applied state law in several cases after York that arguably were controlled by a Federal Rule. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThat is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer. But Hanna changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In Hanna, Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule. York and Byrd both involved such conflicts. York involved a conflict between a state statute and the judicial practice of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And Byrd involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal judicial practice of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these \u2018\u2018relatively unguided\u2019\u2019 Erie conflicts, Hanna reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in Byrd\u2019s language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because \u2018\u2018there can be no other law.\u2019\u2019 Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury\u2019s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy Erie sought to further\u2014uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts\u2014but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the Hanna opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of York\u2019s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are not prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and \u2018\u2018inequitable administration of the laws,\u2019\u2019 that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York line of cases would not require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different. (Notice the difference between this analysis and the analysis following Question 1.) That\u2019s Hanna Part I. It\u2019s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in Hanna, unlike in York or in Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna construed Congress\u2019s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is \u2018\u2018rationally capable of classification\u2019\u2019 as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the \u2018\u2018outcome-determinative\u2019\u2019 test of York, or the more refined outcome-determinative test of Hanna Part I. But the rule involved in Hanna wasn\u2019t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to \u2018\u2018prescribe general rules of practice and procedure\u2019\u2019 for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a). In Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress\u2019s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted \u00a72072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that \u2018\u2018really regulates procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\u2019\u2019 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress\u2019s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress\u2019s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court\u2019s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b) provides that the Rules \u2018\u2018shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u2019\u2019 Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, \u00a72072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \u00a72072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and\u2014even if it is\u2014it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the \u2018\u2018modified outcome-determinative test\u2019\u2019 of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the \u2018\u2018Supreme Law of the Land.\u2019\u2019 United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help. Always start by classifying the problem: Is it modified outcome-determination problem, which the court must decide under Hanna Part I, or a Rules Enabling Act problem, to be addressed under Hanna Part II?\n\nQuestion:\n3. Branches of the decision tree. The State of Emporia has a statute that bars introduction of evidence that a party in a motor vehicle case was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of an accident. This statute prevents use of such evidence to show that the plaintiff was negligent, which, under Emporia negligence law, would reduce her recovery by whatever percentage of negligence the jury ascribes to her. In federal court, assume that no Federal Rule applies, but that judges generally hold that evidence is admitted if it is relevant to an issue in the case. The no-seatbelt evidence would be relevant to the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence. Tancredi sues Maguire for injuries in an accident. At trial, Maguire offers evidence that Tancredi was not wearing his seatbelt. The federal judge should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nexclude the evidence, because admitting it when the state court would not would lead to forum shopping and inequitable administration of the laws.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo the winner must be D or E. It should be D. The seat-belt evidence could make a big difference to Tancredi\u2019s case, since a jury might ascribe a large percentage of negligence to her for failing to wear a seatbelt. Thus, this difference between federal and state practice would significantly affect the choice between the two systems\u2014plaintiffs would choose state court, but defendants would very likely remove to get this evidence in front of the jury\u2014and the litigation opportunities in each. Consequently, under Hanna Part I, the federal court should follow the state practice. Here\u2019s another question to probe the relationship of the two Hanna tests.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThat is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer. But Hanna changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In Hanna, Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule. York and Byrd both involved such conflicts. York involved a conflict between a state statute and the judicial practice of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And Byrd involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal judicial practice of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these \u2018\u2018relatively unguided\u2019\u2019 Erie conflicts, Hanna reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in Byrd\u2019s language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because \u2018\u2018there can be no other law.\u2019\u2019 Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury\u2019s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy Erie sought to further\u2014uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts\u2014but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the Hanna opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of York\u2019s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are not prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and \u2018\u2018inequitable administration of the laws,\u2019\u2019 that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court.

It\u2019s dicta, actually, because Warren went on to note that in Hanna, unlike in York or in Byrd, the conflict was between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure. Conflicts between state practice and the Federal Rules must be analyzed differently, he concluded, for some fairly sophisticated reasons. The Federal Rules are adopted by the Supreme Court, under authority delegated to it by Congress in the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072ff (REA). Consequently, when a Federal Rule is challenged in a diversity case, the issue is whether Congress had the power to enact such a Rule itself, and whether it has delegated that power to the Court in the REA. If Congress has the power to write such a rule, and has validly delegated that authority to the Court, the Rule is valid and will apply, even if it contradicts state procedure. Hanna construed Congress\u2019s power to write procedural rules for the federal courts very broadly indeed: [T]he constitutional provision for a federal court system (augmented by the Necessary and Proper Clause) carries with it congressional power to make rules governing the practice and pleading in those courts, which in turn includes a power to regulate matters which, though falling within the uncertain area between substance and procedure, are rationally capable of classification as either. 380 U.S. at 472. This suggests that Congress could constitutionally mandate any procedure in the federal courts that is \u2018\u2018rationally capable of classification\u2019\u2019 as procedural . . . even if it is also rationally capable of classification as substantive. Under such a broad test, Congress would have the power to write many procedural rules for the courts that would fail the \u2018\u2018outcome-determinative\u2019\u2019 test of York, or the more refined outcome-determinative test of Hanna Part I. But the rule involved in Hanna wasn\u2019t written by Congress; it was adopted by the Supreme Court, pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, in which Congress delegated to the Court authority to \u2018\u2018prescribe general rules of practice and procedure\u2019\u2019 for the federal district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a). In Hanna, the Supreme Court interpreted this delegation of Congress\u2019s power to regulate procedure in the federal courts very broadly as well. In the second part of Hanna, Chief Justice Warren interpreted \u00a72072 to authorize the Court to adopt any rule that \u2018\u2018really regulates procedure,\u2014the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly administering remedy and redress for disregard or infraction of them.\u2019\u2019 380 U.S. at 464 (quoting from Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.S. 1, 14 (1941)). This wide-ranging test suggests that Congress\u2019s delegation to the Court to write the Rules is virtually as broad as Congress\u2019s own expansive power to write rules to govern federal procedure. However, the second subsection of the Rules Enabling Act circumscribes the Court\u2019s rule-making power: 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(b) provides that the Rules \u2018\u2018shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.\u2019\u2019 Even if a Rule satisfies 28 U.S.C. \u00a72072(a), because it addresses a procedural matter, \u00a72072(b) bars the Court from adopting Federal Rules that interfere with substantive rights. When this carve-out for rules that trench on state substantive rights applies is exquisitely unclear. No Supreme Court case has held one of the Federal Rules invalid under \u00a72072(b). In Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.S. 393 (2010), a majority of the Justices suggested that an otherwise valid and applicable Federal Rule will very rarely run afoul of that proviso. See 559 U.S. at 406-410 (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.); 559 U.S. at 432 (Stevens, J., concurring). So, for conflicts involving a Federal Rule, the question to ask is not whether applying it might lead to a different outcome than state law. Rather, the question is whether the Court had the power to adopt the Rule. It must be broadly procedural, under the Sibbach test, and\u2014even if it is\u2014it must not alter substantive rights. If it meets this two-part test, it is valid, and will apply, even if it leads to a different outcome than the plaintiff would obtain in state court. The bottom line after Hanna is that deciding whether the federal court must follow state practice requires a different analysis depending on the source of the conflicting federal practice. If the conflict involves a federal judicial practice, the \u2018\u2018modified outcome-determinative test\u2019\u2019 of Hanna Part I applies. If it involves a conflict between state law and a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the question under Hanna Part II is whether the Court had the power to write the rule. If it did, it applies, since valid federal law is the \u2018\u2018Supreme Law of the Land.\u2019\u2019 United States Constitution, Article VI. This is heavy sledding. I hope the questions will help.

Branches of the decision tree. The State of Emporia has a statute that bars introduction of evidence that a party in a motor vehicle case was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of an accident. This statute prevents use of such evidence to show that the plaintiff was negligent, which, under Emporia negligence law, would reduce her recovery by whatever percentage of negligence the jury ascribes to her. In federal court, assume that no Federal Rule applies, but that judges generally hold that evidence is admitted if it is relevant to an issue in the case. The no-seatbelt evidence would be relevant to the issue of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence. Tancredi sues Maguire for injuries in an accident.

It is not the test for choosing between a federal judicial practice, like the federal practice here, and state law. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThat is how matters stood until 1964, when the Supreme Court decided Hanna v. Plumer. But Hanna changed the landscape by fracturing the analysis for state/federal conflicts in diversity cases into two parts. In Hanna, Chief Justice Warren recognized that conflicts between state and federal practice arise in two different contexts. The first is a conflict between state law and federal judicial practices, that is, procedural rules developed by federal judges but not mandated by a federal statute or a Federal Rule. York and Byrd both involved such conflicts. York involved a conflict between a state statute and the judicial practice of applying the equitable laches doctrine. And Byrd involved a conflict between a state judicial practice of having the judge decide employee status and federal judicial practice of having the jury decide all factual issues. The federal approach in these cases was judge-made; no Federal Rule was involved. In these \u2018\u2018relatively unguided\u2019\u2019 Erie conflicts, Hanna reaffirmed that the question is whether the policy of uniform outcomes requires deference to state law. Of course, the federal court must defer on matters of pure substance, like the duty of care to a trespasser, or the validity of an exclusive contract. On such matters, or those (in Byrd\u2019s language) bound up with substantive rights, state law must apply, because \u2018\u2018there can be no other law.\u2019\u2019 Hanna, 380 U.S. at 472. But in the grey area between substance and procedure, questions like whether the judge or jury decides a particular question, or the standard for reviewing a jury\u2019s verdict, the problem is one of policy, not constitutional command. Here, the decision whether to defer to state law should be approached with sensitivity to the policy Erie sought to further\u2014uniform administration of state law in the state and federal courts\u2014but also with sensitivity to other policies. So, in the first part of the Hanna opinion (see 380 U.S. at 466-469), Chief Justice Warren suggested a more focused version of York\u2019s outcome-determinative test to decide between state law and federal judicial practices which are not prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The court should consider whether applying the federal approach rather than the state rule would lead to forum shopping and \u2018\u2018inequitable administration of the laws,\u2019\u2019 that is, significantly different litigation opportunities for diversity litigants than for those who must proceed in state court. And, the Court suggested, this question should be viewed prospectively; that is, the judge should ask whether the litigant, before filing suit, would have significantly greater litigation opportunities in federal court if that court followed its own practice instead of state law on the disputed issue. Applying this test, Chief Justice Warren concluded that, if the last- and-usual-place-of-abode service rule were a matter of federal judicial practice rather than prescribed in a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, the Erie-York line of cases would not require the judge to apply state law. Following the federal approach would only require the plaintiff to serve process in a slightly different manner, a difference too slight to affect her choice of forum or provide unfair advantages to diverse plaintiffs over nondiverse plaintiffs. So, if the federal approach were a matter of judicial practice, the federal court could follow that practice, even though state law was different.

Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This \u2018\u2018aggregation\u2019\u2019 problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot \u2018\u2018aggregate\u2019\u2019 claims against different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a \u2018\u2018common, undivided interest.\u2019\u2019 (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at Chapter 14, pp. 279-283. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.\n\nQuestion:\n10. Aggravation of damages. Maurice sues O\u2019Connell in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, seeking recovery on a libel claim for $25,000 and an unrelated negligence claim, for $65,000. He also joins Parker as a codefendant on the negligence claim, seeking his $65,000 in negligence damages from Parker. Assume that Maurice\u2019s claims do not involve a \u2018\u2018common undivided interest.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nMaurice does not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement against Parker, but does against O\u2019Connell.\n\nAnalysis:\nA is correct. Maurice meets the amount requirement against O\u2019Connell, by adding his two unrelated claims against him. But he cannot add Parker as a codefendant, since he seeks less than $75,000.01 in damages from him. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nIf a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement? Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This \u2018\u2018aggregation\u2019\u2019 problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot \u2018\u2018aggregate\u2019\u2019 claims against different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a \u2018\u2018common, undivided interest.\u2019\u2019 (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at Chapter 14, pp. 279-283. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.\n\nQuestion:\n10. Aggravation of damages. Maurice sues O\u2019Connell in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, seeking recovery on a libel claim for $25,000 and an unrelated negligence claim, for $65,000.

Everything else is treated as denied.\n\nAnalysis:\nThis question simply requires you to compare Patterson\u2019s allegations with the defendant\u2019s responses, and apply the provisions of Rule 8 as to the effect of a denial, failure to deny, or allegation that the pleader is \u2018\u2018without sufficient facts to form a belief.\u2019\u2019 (Remember, my questions assume that you have the Rule in front of you. I\u2019m not testing whether you remember the provisions of the rule, though your professor might. Rather, the questions test whether you can apply the rules to these allegations and responses.) Naturally, AE has admitted that Adair was its employee, by admitting it! (Sometimes even the pleading rules are commonsensical.) The allegation that Adair was talking on his cell phone is treated as denied: Under the Rule 8(b)(5), the \u2018\u2018without sufficient information\u2019\u2019 response is treated as a denial. Adair hasn\u2019t responded at all to the allegation that Adair acted in the scope of employment at the time of the accident. Frequently, defendants would like to ignore allegations in the complaint, if they aren\u2019t sure of their truth, or it would be awkward to admit them. But this head-in-the-sand strategy doesn\u2019t work under the Rules: Rule 8(b)(6) provides that allegations that are not denied are deemed admitted. So, effectively, AE has admitted that Adair was its employee and that he acted in the scope of employment, but denied negligence and that Adair was chatting on the cell phone. So, B is right.\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nHere\u2019s another example, again calling for judgment concerning the discretionary decision whether to grant an amendment. Note that here the amendment seeks to change the legal claims rather than the factual allegations.  Usually, the occasion to seek an amendment arises later in the action, as parties review documents, depose witnesses, prepare testimony, and research their legal claims and defenses. Thus, the time for amendment as of right will have passed, and the party who wants to amend will have to seek leave of court\u2014that is, the judge\u2019s permission\u2014or consent of the other party, to amend the pleading. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Under Rule 15(a)(2), the judge should generally grant amendments, so that cases can proceed based on the parties\u2019 educated understanding of the facts and theories of recovery. If a party has learned that the facts are not what she initially pleaded, or that she should have alleged a different legal claim or defense than she did at the outset, she should be allowed to amend the pleadings to conform to her evolving understanding of her case. The goal is to have the trial reflect the true state of the evidence, not the parties\u2019 initial understandings when they filed the complaint and answer. If parties were stuck with the positions in the complaint and answer, they would frequently have to try the case based on allegations or defenses that appeared correct at the time, but were not borne out by further research and discovery. The whole thrust of the Federal Rules is to avoid such calcification of legal procedure. Consequently, Rule 15(a) (2) provides that the court should \u2018\u2018freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires.\u2019\u2019 The presumption, especially early in the litigation, is that amendments will be allowed, so that the issues framed for trial will reflect the parties\u2019 fully developed understanding of the case. However, while amendments are liberally allowed, they are not always granted. A common reason to deny leave to amend is that the amendment is offered too late, when the opposing party will be unable to develop the evidence or arguments to meet the new allegation. As trial approaches, the tension increases between the premium the Federal Rules place on flexibility to reframe the issues and the due process right to an adequate opportunity to meet the claim. A change of position that might be fair in the first weeks of a case would be manifestly unfair a week before trial. The grant or denial of an amendment is a discretionary decision, which means it\u2019s committed to the judge\u2019s good judgment, and in many cases either granting or denying the amendment would be reasonable.

Jhala is injured while riding an off-road vehicle over the dunes. He retains a lawyer, Pope, to bring a suit against Adventure Vehicles, Inc., the company that manufactured the vehicle. Pope files suit, seeking recovery on a theory of strict products liability, that is, that the defendant is liable, without fault, for selling a defective vehicle that injured Jhala. His theory is that the ORV was built with too narrow a wheelbase, making it dangerously prone to rolling over. At a discovery conference, the federal judge sets a schedule for discovery that calls for completion of discovery in nine months, and trial several months thereafter. Six months later, Pope remembers what is basic black letter law in his state: that conscious misuse would be a complete defense to Jhala\u2019s products liability claim, but misuse would only reduce recovery (under comparative negligence) if he sued on a negligence theory. He moves to amend to assert a second claim for relief, alleging that Adventure was negligent in designing the vehicle with too narrow a wheel base. The judge will likely\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nallow the amendment, because it facilitates a decision on the merits, even if Jhala\u2019s counsel should have asserted it in the initial complaint.\n\nAnalysis:\nGiven the fact that the amendment comes while there is still three months for further discovery, the judge would very likely allow the amendment, as D indicates. There\u2019s another reason why \u2018\u2018justice\u2019\u2019 would support allowing the amendment here. Doubtless, the parties were already investigating Jhala\u2019s conduct, since misuse of the vehicle would be a complete defense to the original products liability claim. Adding a negligence claim means that his conduct will be assessed against an additional standard, but the parties were very likely already developing the factual evidence about that conduct before the amendment. Consequently, allowing the amendment will not likely prejudice Adventure\u2019s ability to present a full defense. Despite the last two questions, I don\u2019t want to leave the impression that amendments are always granted. They aren\u2019t. As the case gets close to trial, the prejudice to the opposing party, who must gear up to meet an unexpected claim or defense, is likely to counterbalance the policy in favor of amendments, especially if a court-established deadline for amendments has passed.

Jhala is injured while riding an off-road vehicle over the dunes. He retains a lawyer, Pope, to bring a suit against Adventure Vehicles, Inc., the company that manufactured the vehicle. Pope files suit, seeking recovery on a theory of strict products liability, that is, that the defendant is liable, without fault, for selling a defective vehicle that injured Jhala. His theory is that the ORV was built with too narrow a wheelbase, making it dangerously prone to rolling over. At a discovery conference, the federal judge sets a schedule for discovery that calls for completion of discovery in nine months, and trial several months thereafter. Six months later, Pope remembers what is basic black letter law in his state: that conscious misuse would be a complete defense to Jhala\u2019s products liability claim, but misuse would only reduce recovery (under comparative negligence) if he sued on a negligence theory. He moves to amend to assert a second claim for relief, alleging that Adventure was negligent in designing the vehicle with too narrow a wheel base. The judge will likely\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ndeny the amendment, because Jhala can still proceed on a strict products liability theory, and may recover on this ground.\n\nAnalysis:\nC suggests that the amendment should be denied because Jhala might still win on the products liability theory, even if barred from asserting the additional negligence claim. But Rule 15(a)(2) favors allowing the parties to present all their claims and defenses, even if belatedly invoked. See also Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(3) (pleading may assert as many claims or defenses as the party has). It would be cold comfort to Jhala to be told that he can\u2019t present his strongest claim because he can still proceed with a weaker one. It is unlikely that the court would do so. Given the fact that the amendment comes while there is still three months for further discovery, the judge would very likely allow the amendment. There\u2019s another reason why \u2018\u2018justice\u2019\u2019 would support allowing the amendment here. Doubtless, the parties were already investigating Jhala\u2019s conduct, since misuse of the vehicle would be a complete defense to the original products liability claim. Adding a negligence claim means that his conduct will be assessed against an additional standard, but the parties were very likely already developing the factual evidence about that conduct before the amendment. Consequently, allowing the amendment will not likely prejudice Adventure\u2019s ability to present a full defense. Despite the last two questions, I don\u2019t want to leave the impression that amendments are always granted. They aren\u2019t. As the case gets close to trial, the prejudice to the opposing party, who must gear up to meet an unexpected claim or defense, is likely to counterbalance the policy in favor of amendments, especially if a court-established deadline for amendments has passed.

You\u2019d feel the same way. \u2018\u2018Hey, wait! This case doesn\u2019t belong here; throw it out.\u2019\u2019 All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court\u2019s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019 The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have \u2018\u2018appeared generally,\u2019\u2019 waiving her special appearance and accepting the court\u2019s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \u2018\u2018special appearance\u2019\u2019 had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\u2019s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\u2019s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here\u2019s a question to test the point. I\u2019ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you\u2019ve read the discussion above it should be easy.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Something special. Ito, a stockbroker, lives and works in Massachusetts, a state that has modeled its rules of procedure after the Federal Rules. He is served in Massachusetts with the complaint and summons in an action Ervin has brought against him in a Nevada court, seeking recovery for misrepresentation in the sale of stock. Assume that Nevada requires a defendant to challenge jurisdiction through the traditional special appearance. Ito\u2019s attorney files a special appearance in the Nevada court objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. A week later, while the objection is pending, he files a motion to dismiss claiming that the case was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations. The court would\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nconclude that Ito had waived his objection to personal jurisdiction by raising the limitations issue.\n\nAnalysis:\nB is the best answer. By the procedural faux pas of asserting the limitations objection, Ito has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction and the court will proceed to hear the case. It is true that, if Ito\u2019s lawyer had filed the same two objections in a state that uses the Federal Rules approach, his objection to personal jurisdiction would not be waived. But he didn\u2019t. The special appearance approach is more restrictive, and when in Nevada, you have to do as the Nevadans do.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she\u2019s been sued in the wrong court is to protest.

For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have \u2018\u2018appeared generally,\u2019\u2019 waiving her special appearance and accepting the court\u2019s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \u2018\u2018special appearance\u2019\u2019 had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\u2019s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\u2019s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here\u2019s a question to test the point. I\u2019ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you\u2019ve read the discussion above it should be easy.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Something special. Ito, a stockbroker, lives and works in Massachusetts, a state that has modeled its rules of procedure after the Federal Rules. He is served in Massachusetts with the complaint and summons in an action Ervin has brought against him in a Nevada court, seeking recovery for misrepresentation in the sale of stock. Assume that Nevada requires a defendant to challenge jurisdiction through the traditional special appearance. Ito\u2019s attorney files a special appearance in the Nevada court objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. A week later, while the objection is pending, he files a motion to dismiss claiming that the case was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations. The court would\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nconclude that Ito had improperly raised his jurisdictional objection, but still consider it and dismiss if it appears that there is no proper basis for jurisdiction over him.\n\nAnalysis:\nD is interesting. Might the court agree that Ito had made a procedural misstep, but still consider the jurisdictional issue, if it appears that the court lacks a basis for requiring Ito to defend in Nevada? Almost certainly not. The point of the special appearance rule is that an appearance that contests any issue other than jurisdiction is a consent to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Thus, even if Ito has no minimum contacts with Nevada, and there is no other basis for suing him there, his counsel\u2019s in- court conduct of arguing to the merits constitutes a voluntary submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Unlike an objection to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, the personal jurisdiction objection may be waived. The very point of the special appearance rule is that the defendant waives it by combining it with other objections. Consequently, the court need not consider whether there is some other basis for exercising jurisdiction over Ito. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she\u2019s been sued in the wrong court is to protest.

But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here\u2019s a question to test the point. I\u2019ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you\u2019ve read the discussion above it should be easy.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Something special. Ito, a stockbroker, lives and works in Massachusetts, a state that has modeled its rules of procedure after the Federal Rules. He is served in Massachusetts with the complaint and summons in an action Ervin has brought against him in a Nevada court, seeking recovery for misrepresentation in the sale of stock. Assume that Nevada requires a defendant to challenge jurisdiction through the traditional special appearance. Ito\u2019s attorney files a special appearance in the Nevada court objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. A week later, while the objection is pending, he files a motion to dismiss claiming that the case was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations. The court would\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nconclude that Ito had improperly raised his jurisdictional objection, but still consider it and dismiss if it appears that there is no proper basis for jurisdiction over him.\n\nAnalysis:\nD is interesting. Might the court agree that Ito had made a procedural misstep, but still consider the jurisdictional issue, if it appears that the court lacks a basis for requiring Ito to defend in Nevada? Almost certainly not. The point of the special appearance rule is that an appearance that contests any issue other than jurisdiction is a consent to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Thus, even if Ito has no minimum contacts with Nevada, and there is no other basis for suing him there, his counsel\u2019s in- court conduct of arguing to the merits constitutes a voluntary submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. Unlike an objection to the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction, the personal jurisdiction objection may be waived. The very point of the special appearance rule is that the defendant waives it by combining it with other objections. Consequently, the court need not consider whether there is some other basis for exercising jurisdiction over Ito. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she\u2019s been sued in the wrong court is to protest. You\u2019d feel the same way. \u2018\u2018Hey, wait! This case doesn\u2019t belong here; throw it out.\u2019\u2019 All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court\u2019s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019 The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have \u2018\u2018appeared generally,\u2019\u2019 waiving her special appearance and accepting the court\u2019s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \u2018\u2018special appearance\u2019\u2019 had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\u2019s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\u2019s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction.

The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties\u2019 relative access to relevant information, the parties\u2019 resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of \u2018\u2018any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.\u2019\u2019 In an effort to rein in discovery, the \u2018\u2018relevant to the claim or defense of any party\u2019\u2019 language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to \u2018\u2018the subject matter of the pending action,\u2019\u2019 but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called \u2018\u2018proportionality factors\u2019\u2019 in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the \u2018\u2018relevant to a claim or defense in the action\u2019\u2019 standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff\u2019s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants\u2019 arguments to resist discovery.

Karim\u2019s counsel sends an interrogatory to Precision asking whether, at any time between the accident and the present, it has added a safety guard to the machine that injured Karim (which it has). Under the relevant rules of evidence, evidence of such \u2018\u2018subsequent remedial measures\u2019\u2019 is not admissible in an action to establish that the defendant was negligent in failing to take a similar precaution before the plaintiff\u2019s injury.

For example, the hearsay statement \u2018\u2018I heard Smith say that a Federal Express delivery man drove away after the accident\u2019\u2019 might be inadmissible hearsay. But this information could clearly assist the plaintiff in finding an important witness.

But the information would be subject to discovery, if it is relevant to a claim or defense in the action. Here\u2019s a first question on the scope of discovery under Rule 26(b)(1).\n\nQuestion:\n1. Time past and time future. Karim sues Precision Machine Company after she suffers a serious injury to her hand using a stamping machine manufactured by Precision. Her suit is brought after the statute of limitations on a strict products liability claim has expired, so her complaint alleges negligence by Precision in the design of the machine. Karim\u2019s counsel sends an interrogatory to Precision asking whether, at any time between the accident and the present, it has added a safety guard to the machine that injured Karim (which it has). Under the relevant rules of evidence, evidence of such \u2018\u2018subsequent remedial measures\u2019\u2019 is not admissible in an action to establish that the defendant was negligent in failing to take a similar precaution before the plaintiff\u2019s injury. The purpose of this rule of evidence is to encourage defendants to eliminate unsafe conditions, without fear that such safety measures will be introduced at trial to establish liability for not taking those measures before. The information sought in the interrogatory\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nis within the scope of discovery under the current standard in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1).\n\nAnalysis:\nD is the best answer. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nA good place to start is with the basic question of the scope of discovery, that is, what issues the parties may inquire about through the discovery process. The answer is in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1), which governs the scope of discovery through each of the discovery devices. Whether information is sought through a deposition, an interrogatory, or production of documents, the Rule 26(b)(1) standard applies. Scope in General. Unless otherwise limited by court order, the scope of discovery is as follows: Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged matter that is relevant to any party\u2019s claim or defense and proportional to the needs of the case, considering the importance of the issues at stake in the action, the amount in controversy, the parties\u2019 relative access to relevant information, the parties\u2019 resources, the importance of the discovery in resolving the issues, and whether the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit. Information within this scope of discovery need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable. This provision sounds pretty broad, but actually used to be broader in several respects. Prior to an amendment in 2000, Rule 26(b)(1) allowed discovery of \u2018\u2018any matter, not privileged, relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action.\u2019\u2019 In an effort to rein in discovery, the \u2018\u2018relevant to the claim or defense of any party\u2019\u2019 language was substituted. Thus, some information relevant to \u2018\u2018the subject matter of the pending action,\u2019\u2019 but not relevant to any claim or defense asserted by a party in that action, was discoverable before 2000 and now is not. In addition, an amendment in 2015 added the so-called \u2018\u2018proportionality factors\u2019\u2019 in the second sentence to the definition of the scope of discovery in Rule 26(b)(1). Most of these factors had previously been included in Rule 26(b)(2)(C)(iii), which authorized district court judges to consider them in deciding whether to limit discovery. In light of that, moving the (mostly) identical factors into the definition of the scope of discovery might not seem like much of a change. However, the change will presumably encourage judges to consider these factors in limiting discovery that otherwise meets the \u2018\u2018relevant to a claim or defense in the action\u2019\u2019 standard. The amendment was opposed by plaintiff\u2019s lawyers on the ground that, by emphasizing the discovery limits, it would likely provide ammunition for defendants\u2019 arguments to resist discovery. Rule 26(b)(1) expressly provides that information is discoverable even though it isn\u2019t admissible as evidence at a trial. \u2018\u2018Relevant information need not be admissible in evidence to be discoverable.\u2019\u2019 For example, statements that are \u2018\u2018hearsay,\u2019\u2019 that is, statements made by one person concerning statements by another, are not generally admissible at trial.

Suppose, for example, that Harris brings a federal diversity action against Tanfredi for $60,000 in damages suffered in an auto accident, and also, in the same suit, seeks $40,000 from him in damages for breach of a contract. This \u2018\u2018aggregation\u2019\u2019 problem bedevils law students, and makes good fodder for testing. The basic rule is that a plaintiff can add up the amounts for all her claims against a single defendant, whether they are related or not. However, she cannot \u2018\u2018aggregate\u2019\u2019 claims against different defendants, except in the unusual situation where they are sued on a \u2018\u2018common, undivided interest.\u2019\u2019 (Please disregard this exception for the moment.) Harris meets the amount requirement in the example just given. However, if she sued Tanfredi for $60,000, and Vincent, in the same action for $40,000, she would not meet the amount requirement against either, since she cannot add together the amounts sought against different defendants to meet the requirement. The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at Chapter 14, pp. 279-283. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.\n\nQuestion:\n10. Aggravation of damages. Maurice sues O\u2019Connell in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, seeking recovery on a libel claim for $25,000 and an unrelated negligence claim, for $65,000. He also joins Parker as a codefendant on the negligence claim, seeking his $65,000 in negligence damages from Parker. Assume that Maurice\u2019s claims do not involve a \u2018\u2018common undivided interest.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nMaurice does not meet the amount-in-controversy requirement against Parker, but does against O\u2019Connell.\n\nAnalysis:\nA is correct. Maurice meets the amount requirement against O\u2019Connell, by adding his two unrelated claims against him. But he cannot add Parker as a codefendant, since he seeks less than $75,000.01 in damages from him. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nIf a plaintiff brings more than one claim, can she add her damages on the claims together to meet the amount-in-controversy requirement?

The situation is less clear where two plaintiffs join together to sue a defendant, and one sues for more than $75,000 but the other for less. Prior to enactment of 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367, the supplemental jurisdiction statute, the answer was clear: each plaintiff had to meet the amount requirement on her own. If Couples and Jenks sued Barone, and Couples sought $50,000 in damages, and Jenks sought $60,000, neither met the amount requirement. If Couples sought $90,000 and Jenks joined with him, seeking $20,000, Couples met the requirement, but Jenks did not. Now, however, 28 U.S.C. \u00a71367 has changed this result in the multiple- plaintiff situation. This problem is discussed in more detail at Chapter 14, pp. 279-283. You can analyze this question without worrying about the supplemental jurisdiction statute, since it involves claims against multiple defendants, not by multiple plaintiffs. As to multiple defendants, the traditional rule, that the plaintiff must meet the amount requirement separately against each, still applies.\n\nQuestion:\n10. Aggravation of damages. Maurice sues O\u2019Connell in federal court based on diversity jurisdiction, seeking recovery on a libel claim for $25,000 and an unrelated negligence claim, for $65,000. He also joins Parker as a codefendant on the negligence claim, seeking his $65,000 in negligence damages from Parker. Assume that Maurice\u2019s claims do not involve a \u2018\u2018common undivided interest.\u2019\u2019\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nMaurice meets the amount-in-controversy requirement against both defendants, since he seeks $90,000 in total recovery.\n\nAnalysis:\nAnd B is wrong, because the aggregation rules don\u2019t allow aggregation of amounts sought against different defendants. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nUnder federal diversity jurisdiction a citizen of one state may sue a citizen of another in federal court, even though her claim arises under state law, if she has a colorable claim for more than $75,000.

But in one respect they can be more effective than depositions. An interrogatory to a corporate party requires the party \u2018\u2018to furnish such information as is available to the party,\u2019\u2019 (emphasis added) not just information that the person answering them personally knows. Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(1)(B). Thus, the party answering the interrogatories must make a reasonable inquiry to obtain the information requested. By contrast, a deponent will generally answer at a deposition based solely on personal knowledge. If a party believes that the information sought is not within the scope of discovery, or is protected from disclosure, the party should respond by objecting to the interrogatory. For example, if an interrogatory asked for all statements taken from any witness, the responding party could object based on work product protection under Rule 26(b)(3). The responding party signs the interrogatories under oath, but any objections raised are to be signed by the attorney making them. Rule 33(b)(5). This emphasizes that it is the lawyers who interpose legal objections to discovery (and, consequently, may be sanctioned if such objections are not justified). Which is the proper response to the interrogatory below?  interrogatories, depositions, and requests for production of documents have been available under the Federal Rules since their adoption in 1938. Interrogatories are simply questions, sent by one party to the case to be answered by another. (They may not be used to obtain information from nonparties.) A major advantage of interrogatories is that they are inexpensive. You just write them and send them, and hopefully get useful information back in the answers. However, the answers are not spontaneous; they are written by the responding party\u2019s lawyer, who, as an advocate for the opposing party, tends to construe interrogatories narrowly and respond with as little information as possible. Interrogatories should be precise and specific, in order to get something precise and specific in return. Thus they are best used to obtain objective factual information such as names of witnesses, itemizations of damages, dates of relevant events, and the location of known documents. This type of information can be clearly described in an interrogatory, in a manner that is not subject to a limiting construction by opposing counsel. For more subjective inquiries, interrogatories tend to produce unsatisfying results. A long-running source of debate has been the extent to which parties may ask interrogatories that call for opinions or contentions. For example, an interrogatory might ask the plaintiff in a contracts case to specify \u2018\u2018each act upon which the plaintiff relies in support of her contention that the defendant breached the contract.\u2019\u2019 This is not a purely factual question, like \u2018\u2018Please state where the meeting between Smith and Jones took place.\u2019\u2019 Instead, such \u2018\u2018contention interrogatories\u2019\u2019 call for the application of law to fact, for the party to provide factual support for a position taken in the pleadings. Rule 33(a)(2) confirms that such interrogatories are proper, though the court may allow a party to defer answering them until discovery is complete: An interrogatory is not objectionable merely because it asks for an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that the interrogatory need not be answered until designated discovery is complete, or until a pretrial conference or some other time. Such contention interrogatories provide a means for opponents to gain an understanding of the factual basis for general allegations in the pleadings. Consider the interrogatory in the following example.  \n\nQuestion:\n5. Reasonable inquiry. Melchior brings a products liability action in federal court against Atmosphere Aviation Corporation, a national airline. She seeks damages for personal injuries suffered in the crash of an Atmosphere plane. She also sues General Engines Corporation, which manufactured the engines on the plane. General Engines has offices in five states. Atmosphere Aviation sends interrogatories to General Engines, requesting it to list all reports it has in its possession concerning accidents over the last ten years involving the type of engine involved in the crash, and the names of the persons conducting those investigations. Branch, the vice president for operations of General Engines, is designated to respond to the interrogatories for the corporation. While Branch oversees all General\u2019s operations, she does not have all the information sought by the interrogatory; much of it is located in files in offices at other corporate locations. Branch should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nconduct an investigation to determine what relevant documents General has, and answer based on that investigation.\n\nAnalysis:\nChoose A. You can imagine how enthusiastic Branch will be about conducting that investigation. At the very least, it is a major distraction from her job; at worst, it can be an enormous burden leading to production of lots of damaging evidence. In some cases, interrogatories may be objectionable on the ground that the burden of responding is too great or that they require the responding party to conduct analyses or gather information that the requesting party should obtain itself. But here, the request probably is not unduly burdensome, since the interrogatory describes precisely the documents to be listed, and there are not likely to be huge numbers of such reports.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe general learning is that interrogatories do not provide much useful information, since they are not answered spontaneously, but labored over by grudging lawyers trying to protect their clients\u2019 interests. But in one respect they can be more effective than depositions. An interrogatory to a corporate party requires the party \u2018\u2018to furnish such information as is available to the party,\u2019\u2019 (emphasis added) not just information that the person answering them personally knows. Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b)(1)(B). Thus, the party answering the interrogatories must make a reasonable inquiry to obtain the information requested. By contrast, a deponent will generally answer at a deposition based solely on personal knowledge. If a party believes that the information sought is not within the scope of discovery, or is protected from disclosure, the party should respond by objecting to the interrogatory. For example, if an interrogatory asked for all statements taken from any witness, the responding party could object based on work product protection under Rule 26(b)(3).

For example, an interrogatory might ask the plaintiff in a contracts case to specify \u2018\u2018each act upon which the plaintiff relies in support of her contention that the defendant breached the contract.\u2019\u2019 This is not a purely factual question, like \u2018\u2018Please state where the meeting between Smith and Jones took place.\u2019\u2019 Instead, such \u2018\u2018contention interrogatories\u2019\u2019 call for the application of law to fact, for the party to provide factual support for a position taken in the pleadings. Rule 33(a)(2) confirms that such interrogatories are proper, though the court may allow a party to defer answering them until discovery is complete: An interrogatory is not objectionable merely because it asks for an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that the interrogatory need not be answered until designated discovery is complete, or until a pretrial conference or some other time. Such contention interrogatories provide a means for opponents to gain an understanding of the factual basis for general allegations in the pleadings. Consider the interrogatory in the following example.  \n\nQuestion:\n5. Reasonable inquiry. Melchior brings a products liability action in federal court against Atmosphere Aviation Corporation, a national airline. She seeks damages for personal injuries suffered in the crash of an Atmosphere plane. She also sues General Engines Corporation, which manufactured the engines on the plane. General Engines has offices in five states. Atmosphere Aviation sends interrogatories to General Engines, requesting it to list all reports it has in its possession concerning accidents over the last ten years involving the type of engine involved in the crash, and the names of the persons conducting those investigations. Branch, the vice president for operations of General Engines, is designated to respond to the interrogatories for the corporation. While Branch oversees all General\u2019s operations, she does not have all the information sought by the interrogatory; much of it is located in files in offices at other corporate locations. Branch should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nconduct an investigation to determine what relevant documents General has, and answer based on that investigation.\n\nAnalysis:\nChoose A. You can imagine how enthusiastic Branch will be about conducting that investigation. At the very least, it is a major distraction from her job; at worst, it can be an enormous burden leading to production of lots of damaging evidence. In some cases, interrogatories may be objectionable on the ground that the burden of responding is too great or that they require the responding party to conduct analyses or gather information that the requesting party should obtain itself. But here, the request probably is not unduly burdensome, since the interrogatory describes precisely the documents to be listed, and there are not likely to be huge numbers of such reports.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe general learning is that interrogatories do not provide much useful information, since they are not answered spontaneously, but labored over by grudging lawyers trying to protect their clients\u2019 interests.

By contrast, a deponent will generally answer at a deposition based solely on personal knowledge. If a party believes that the information sought is not within the scope of discovery, or is protected from disclosure, the party should respond by objecting to the interrogatory. For example, if an interrogatory asked for all statements taken from any witness, the responding party could object based on work product protection under Rule 26(b)(3). The responding party signs the interrogatories under oath, but any objections raised are to be signed by the attorney making them. Rule 33(b)(5).

Which is the proper response to the interrogatory below?  interrogatories, depositions, and requests for production of documents have been available under the Federal Rules since their adoption in 1938. Interrogatories are simply questions, sent by one party to the case to be answered by another. (They may not be used to obtain information from nonparties.) A major advantage of interrogatories is that they are inexpensive. You just write them and send them, and hopefully get useful information back in the answers. However, the answers are not spontaneous; they are written by the responding party\u2019s lawyer, who, as an advocate for the opposing party, tends to construe interrogatories narrowly and respond with as little information as possible. Interrogatories should be precise and specific, in order to get something precise and specific in return. Thus they are best used to obtain objective factual information such as names of witnesses, itemizations of damages, dates of relevant events, and the location of known documents. This type of information can be clearly described in an interrogatory, in a manner that is not subject to a limiting construction by opposing counsel.

The removal statute provides that a diversity case cannot be removed if there is an in-state defendant: \u00a71441(b)(2). A civil action removable solely on the basis of the jurisdiction under section 1332(a) of this title may not be removed if any of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the state in which such action is brought. This is a sensible limit on removal, given the rationale for federal diversity jurisdiction. The logic for allowing diversity cases to be brought in federal court is the risk of prejudice in the state court; but if a defendant is sued in her home state, she is not at risk of prejudice. If Coretta, from Wisconsin, sues Parkins, from Iowa, in an Iowa state court, there is little reason to allow Parkins to remove. Any prejudice in the state court would be in favor of Parkins, so why allow her to bump the case into federal court? Section 1441 (b)(2) therefore bars her from doing so. Consider this illustration.\n\nQuestion:\n2. My state, or yours? Ortiz, a police officer and Georgia citizen, sues Swensson, from North Carolina, and Dracut, from Virginia, in state court in Virginia. He claims that the defendants battered him while he was trying to arrest them. (Battery is a state tort claim.) He credibly alleges $150,000 in damages. Swensson answers the complaint, denying that he battered Ortiz, and asserts in the answer a counterclaim demanding damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, for violation of his federal civil rights in the course of the arrest. Within the thirty-day period for removal, Swensson files a notice of removal in the federal district court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Assume that Dracut agrees to the removal.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe federal court lacks jurisdiction over the case, under \u00a71441(b)(2).\n\nAnalysis:\nSo B is right; under \u00a71441(b)(2) this case is excluded from removal.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nWhy would a plaintiff assert a claim in her complaint that fails to state a compensable claim under applicable law? Well, it may happen for a number of reasons. First, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer may not have done her homework, so she doesn\u2019t realize that a particular claim is legally insufficient. In other cases (unfortunately), lawyers may include legally dubious claims for tactical reasons, even if they doubt that they will ultimately support recovery. And, in another set of cases, it simply may not be clear under applicable law whether the complaint states a legally compensable claim or not. There may not be case law from the state appellate courts that clearly delineates the limits of a legal theory. If that is true, the trial judge faces a difficult task when a plaintiff files a claim and the defendant challenges it as legally insufficient to support relief. Here\u2019s a question that illustrates the trial judge\u2019s dilemma.\n\nQuestion:\n2. Authority on point. Angeles sues Centerville Hospital, a hospital in the state of Euphoria, for medical malpractice by Dr. Kildare, who operated on her at Centerville. Angeles alleges that Dr. Kildare negligently performed the operation, and that Centerville is liable for Kildare\u2019s negligence, even if Kildare was an independent contractor rather than an employee of Centerville. Her theory is that, to the patient, the surgeon appears to be an employee of the hospital, even though surgeons are often actually independent contractors who merely contract for use of hospital facilities. Euphoria courts have never decided whether a hospital is liable for acts of surgeons who use its facilities, under this \u2018\u2018apparent authority\u2019\u2019 theory. Courts in a few other states have accepted the argument, however. In her complaint, Angeles alleges that she reasonably believed that Dr. Kildare was an employee of Centerville. She further alleges that Centerville is liable for Kildare\u2019s negligence, based on this \u2018\u2018apparent authority\u2019\u2019 theory.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe court should not dismiss the complaint, because Angeles\u2019s reasonable belief that Dr. Kildare was an employee is a question of fact, and the motion is only meant to determine the legal sufficiency of the complaint.\n\nAnalysis:\nC asserts that the complaint should not be dismissed, because there is a dispute of fact as to whether Angeles reasonably believed that Dr. Kildare worked for the hospital. The court cannot decide facts on the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, only the legal sufficiency of the complaint. So doesn\u2019t the court have to let the case go forward? As in the last question, the parties will only need to litigate the factual issues if they are relevant to a valid claim. Here, whether Angeles thought Kildare worked for the hospital is irrelevant, if that belief would not make the hospital liable. Even if Angeles believed that Kildare worked for the hospital, her claim must be dismissed if, under Euphoria law, the patient\u2019s belief is not enough to make the hospital vicariously liable for Kildare\u2019s negligence. So, if the court holds that apparent authority is insufficient to impose liability on the hospital, it will dismiss Angeles\u2019s claim, regardless of whether Angeles reasonably believed that Kildare worked for it. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nMy students always get confused about the relationship between removal to federal court and personal jurisdiction. Suppose that a defendant is sued in Arizona and believes that she is not subject to personal jurisdiction there. Naturally, she should object to personal jurisdiction. But suppose further that she isn\u2019t sure that her objection will carry the day; it\u2019s a close issue, as so many personal jurisdiction issues are under minimum contacts analysis. And suppose that her tactical judgment is that, if she must litigate in Arizona, she would rather litigate in federal court in Arizona. What should she do? One thing she could do is to move to dismiss in the Arizona state court. But that motion is not likely to be ruled on within thirty days, and if she\u2019s going to remove, she\u2019s got to do it within thirty days. So she could do one of two things: She could move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction in the state court (assuming that the state rules allow her to do that) and then remove to federal court within the thirty-day period. Her motion would then be pending in federal court instead of state court, and the federal court would rule on it. Or she could remove the case before a response was due in state court, and then, after removal, raise her objection to personal jurisdiction by a Rule 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss or in her answer to the complaint in federal court. Either way, the point is that removal does not waive the defendant\u2019s right to object to personal jurisdiction. It simply changes the court in which the objection will be litigated. It is true that, after removal, the question will be whether the federal court has personal jurisdiction. But generally the scope of personal jurisdiction in the federal court will be the same as that of the state court, because the Federal Rules require the federal court in most cases to conform to state limits on personal jurisdiction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A). I\u2019ve stumped a multitude of students on this point. Consider the following two cases to clarify the point.\n\nQuestion:\n8. Another switch. Yasuda, from Oregon, sues Boyle, from Idaho, on a state law unfair competition claim, seeking $250,000 in damages. He sues in state court in Oregon. Assume that Oregon follows the special appearance rule, under which the defendant may appear to challenge jurisdiction, but waives the objection if she raises any other issues. Boyle answers the complaint in state court, raising her defenses on the merits and including an objection to personal jurisdiction. Three days later Boyle files a notice of removal in federal court. Five days after removing, Boyle renews her motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Boyle\u2019s motion is\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ninvalid, because Boyle responded to the merits in state court, thereby waiving her objection to personal jurisdiction.\n\nAnalysis:\nC is the right answer.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nWhy would a plaintiff assert a claim in her complaint that fails to state a compensable claim under applicable law?

It asserts that the motion should be denied, because the allegations in the complaint must be taken as true in ruling on the motion, and Angeles has alleged that Centerville is liable. Can you see the fallacy in this argument? Surely, the court must take factual allegations in a complaint as true, for purposes of ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, but it need not assume the truth of legal allegations. The legal validity of the claim the plaintiff asserts is exactly what the motion is designed to assess. If the court had to accept the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the cause of action she asserts exists, the motion could never be granted! No, the court will assume the truth of Angeles\u2019s factual allegation that she reasonably believed that Kildare was a Centerville employee, but not her legal assertion that Centerville is liable for his acts if she did. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nWhy would a plaintiff assert a claim in her complaint that fails to state a compensable claim under applicable law?

If the trial court concludes that Euphoria law doesn\u2019t impose liability on a hospital for the acts of an independent contractor/ surgeon (even if the patient thought she worked for the hospital), the trial court will dismiss the claim for \u2018\u2018failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u2019\u2019 In so doing, the trial court is \u2018\u2018making\u2019\u2019 Euphoria law.

And, in another set of cases, it simply may not be clear under applicable law whether the complaint states a legally compensable claim or not. There may not be case law from the state appellate courts that clearly delineates the limits of a legal theory. If that is true, the trial judge faces a difficult task when a plaintiff files a claim and the defendant challenges it as legally insufficient to support relief. Here\u2019s a question that illustrates the trial judge\u2019s dilemma.\n\nQuestion:\n2. Authority on point. Angeles sues Centerville Hospital, a hospital in the state of Euphoria, for medical malpractice by Dr. Kildare, who operated on her at Centerville. Angeles alleges that Dr. Kildare negligently performed the operation, and that Centerville is liable for Kildare\u2019s negligence, even if Kildare was an independent contractor rather than an employee of Centerville. Her theory is that, to the patient, the surgeon appears to be an employee of the hospital, even though surgeons are often actually independent contractors who merely contract for use of hospital facilities. Euphoria courts have never decided whether a hospital is liable for acts of surgeons who use its facilities, under this \u2018\u2018apparent authority\u2019\u2019 theory. Courts in a few other states have accepted the argument, however. In her complaint, Angeles alleges that she reasonably believed that Dr. Kildare was an employee of Centerville. She further alleges that Centerville is liable for Kildare\u2019s negligence, based on this \u2018\u2018apparent authority\u2019\u2019 theory.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe court should not dismiss the complaint, because it must take the allegations in the complaint as true on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), and Angeles has alleged that Centerville is liable for the acts of Dr. Kildare.\n\nAnalysis:\nD is tempting, but wrong. It asserts that the motion should be denied, because the allegations in the complaint must be taken as true in ruling on the motion, and Angeles has alleged that Centerville is liable. Can you see the fallacy in this argument? Surely, the court must take factual allegations in a complaint as true, for purposes of ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, but it need not assume the truth of legal allegations. The legal validity of the claim the plaintiff asserts is exactly what the motion is designed to assess. If the court had to accept the plaintiff\u2019s allegation that the cause of action she asserts exists, the motion could never be granted! No, the court will assume the truth of Angeles\u2019s factual allegation that she reasonably believed that Kildare was a Centerville employee, but not her legal assertion that Centerville is liable for his acts if she did. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nIt makes sense that a party should not be able to take a case to trial if she seeks relief that a court is not able to grant. Suppose, for example, that Arkwright, owner of a car dealership, sues Miranda for negligence. He claims that Miranda caused an accident on Main Street, that because of the accident traffic was unable to reach his dealership for three hours during his President\u2019s Day sale, and as a result he lost profits. Many states limit recovery in negligence cases to direct personal injury or property damage, and would not recognize a right to recover for secondary economic damages like Arkwright\u2019s. See generally D. Dobbs, P. Hayden, and E. Bublick, The Law of Torts (2d ed.) \u00a7611. In these states, a court looking at Arkwright\u2019s complaint could tell that he seeks relief that is not available under the law. Since there is no right to relief, even if Arkwright proves all the facts he has alleged, the court would dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The purpose of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is to test the legal validity of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations, not their factual truth. Consequently, in considering the motion, the court does not ask whether the plaintiff is likely to prove them. The motion does not challenge the plaintiff\u2019s ability to prove her case\u2014as a summary judgment motion does\u2014but only the validity of the legal cause of action she asserts. In ruling on the motion, the court must assume that the facts alleged in the complaint are true. The question for the judge is, if they are all true, do they set forth a claim for which the court could grant the plaintiff some kind of remedy. Here\u2019s a question to illustrate the point.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Law and facts. Snow sues Petrillo for emotional distress he suffered when he witnessed an accident in which Petrillo\u2019s car careened into his parents\u2019 car. The action is brought in federal court in the state of Euphoria, which applies the \u2018\u2018impact rule\u2019\u2019 to claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Under the impact rule a plaintiff can only recover for emotional distress if she actually suffered a physical impact in the accident caused by the defendant. Mere \u2018\u2018bystanders\u2019\u2019 cannot recover. Snow was not in his parents\u2019 car at the time of the accident. He was waving goodbye to them from the curb, where they had just dropped him off. He claims, however, that Petrillo\u2019s car, when it careened into his parents\u2019 car, threw water on his leg, and that this satisfies the impact rule. Petrillo denies that his car threw water on Snow. He also denies that water splashing is sufficient to satisfy the impact rule under Euphoria law; the impact, Petrillo argues, must be with the defendant\u2019s car itself. He answers the complaint, denying that his car splashed Snow, and then moves to dismiss it for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The trial judge should\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nconsider the motion, but deny it if she concludes that water splashing satisfies the impact rule.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo B is right. If the court concludes that splashing doesn\u2019t satisfy the impact rule under Euphoria law, there is no need to prolong the case. The complaint should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. But if the court concludes that water splashing satisfies the impact requirement, the plaintiff will have stated a compensable claim, and the parties will then litigate the contested question of whether the splashing actually occurred.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nWhy would a plaintiff assert a claim in her complaint that fails to state a compensable claim under applicable law? Well, it may happen for a number of reasons. First, the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer may not have done her homework, so she doesn\u2019t realize that a particular claim is legally insufficient. In other cases (unfortunately), lawyers may include legally dubious claims for tactical reasons, even if they doubt that they will ultimately support recovery.

See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) (motion should be granted where there is \u2018\u2018no legally sufficient evidentiary basis\u2019\u2019 for the jury to find for the party opposing the motion). In a case where the plaintiff\u2019s proof is patently inadequate to establish her claim, the judge has the authority to bar the jury from deciding the case, by \u2018\u2018directing a verdict\u2019\u2019 against her. This older name, \u2018\u2018directed verdict,\u2019\u2019 is suggestive of the motion\u2019s purpose: the judge in a sense orders the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, since no other verdict is supportable on the evidence submitted to them. At one time, judges apparently did literally \u2018\u2018direct the verdict,\u2019\u2019 that is, they ordered the jury in such cases to go out and come back with a verdict for the defendant. These days, the judge simply orders a judgment entered for the defendant. The jury has been empaneled and heard the evidence, but doesn\u2019t get to deliberate and reach a verdict, because the judge has concluded, as a matter of law, that the evidence is too weak to support a plaintiff\u2019s verdict. How can the judge do this? What about the constitutional right to jury trial? Well, that right is generally interpreted to guarantee a jury decision only where there is a legitimate dispute in the evidence, where a meaningful dispute exists about whether the facts the plaintiff must establish are true. If there is such a conflict in the evidence, so that reasonable jurors could find for either party, the jury should resolve that conflict by \u2018\u2018finding the facts.\u2019\u2019 However, if the plaintiff has no evidence, or clearly insufficient evidence, to establish a required element of that claim, courts have held that the jury has no legitimate role to play, because its constitutional role as the finder of facts is not required. See Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72522. If it is clear that the plaintiff cannot establish a required element of her claim, there is no need for the jury to consider the case. Courts often speak of two burdens the plaintiff must carry in order to obtain a valid verdict in her favor. First, she bears the burden to convince the judge that her evidence is strong enough on each element of her claim to support a rational verdict in her favor. This is often referred to as the \u2018\u2018burden of production.\u2019\u2019 To avoid a directed verdict, the plaintiff must produce enough evidence that a jury, acting rationally upon that evidence, could find that the elements she must prove are met. It is the judge who decides whether the plaintiff has met the burden of production. In making that decision, she does not ask whether she, were she the fact finder, would be convinced of the truth of the disputed element. Instead, she must ask whether a jury, looking at that evidence, could rationally be convinced of it, that is, if the decision is in the debatable range. If she concludes that the plaintiff has met the burden of production on each element of her claim, she denies the motion for judgment as a matter of law and sends the case to the jury. If the judge concludes that the plaintiff has satisfied the burden to produce credible evidence on each element of her claim, and lets the case go to the jury, the jury must then decide whether she has met her second burden, the burden to prove her case by a preponderance of the evidence. The judge has concluded that a jury rationally could find for her on the evidence produced. Now the jury must decide whether it will find for her, under a more-probable-than-not standard of proof. The jury\u2019s job is to determine whether she has met the \u2018\u2018burden of proof\u2019\u2019 on each element of her claim, while the judge\u2019s role is to decide whether she has met the less onerous burden to produce credible evidence of those elements. Consider the defendant\u2019s motion in the following example. It\u2019s a negligence case. As you have learned or will learn in Torts, there are four elements to a claim for negligence. To recover for negligence, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant owed her a duty of due care, that the defendant breached that duty, that she suffered damages, and that the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty of due care caused her damages.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Elementary principles. Powers sues Dr. Vicaro in federal court for negligence in medical treatment. The case goes to trial, and the plaintiff presents all of her evidence. That evidence shows that she went to Vicaro with complaints of pain in her arm, that he treated her with various drugs, and that the arm has gotten progressively worse, so that now she can barely use it. Her evidence further shows the damages she has suffered due to the loss of use of the arm, including the loss of her job. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the defendant moves for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe motion should be granted, since the plaintiff has not established the right to relief for a negligence claim.\n\nAnalysis:\nC is the best answer here. Powers has presented credible evidence that Vicaro treated her, and that her arm has gotten worse. But if that were enough to establish a claim, doctors would be liable every time a patient had a bad outcome. Recovery for malpractice requires something more: proof that the doctor was negligent, that her treatment fell below the standard of reasonable care. Nothing in the question suggests that Powers presented any evidence to establish what good medical practice required in treatment of Powers\u2019s condition, that Vicaro\u2019s treatment failed to live up to that standard, or that any substandard treatment was the cause of Powers\u2019s loss of use of the arm. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe purpose of the directed verdict motion is to ask the trial judge to take the case away from the jury, on the ground that the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiff.

At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the defendant moves for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe motion should be denied, because it can only be made after the jury deliberates, not before.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet\u2019s quickly dispose of the last choice. D is wrong because, if a plaintiff\u2019s proof is legally insufficient (if she has failed to meet her \u2018\u2018burden of production\u2019\u2019), the judge has the power to order a judgment as a matter of law for the defendant without letting the jury decide the case. True, she could deny the motion, let the jury deliberate and reach a verdict, and then reconsider whether the evidence is sufficient on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). But she also has the authority, under Rule 50(a), to withdraw the case from the jury before it deliberates, by granting judgment as a matter of law. If she does, the jury never will deliberate on the case. B is also incorrect. It suggests that the defendant must wait until the close of all the evidence to challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s case. Under the Federal Rules\u2014and, I\u2019ll wager, under those of most states\u2014the defendant may raise that challenge as soon as the plaintiff has had her full chance to present sufficient evidence to get to the jury. When the plaintiff \u2018\u2018rests her case,\u2019\u2019 that is, announces that she has put on all her evidence, she has had her full opportunity to establish a credible case on each element of her claim. At that point, she has presumably presented everything she\u2019s got to establish breach, causation, and damages,1 so it\u2019s fair to stop the process if, having had that full opportunity, she has failed to produce a submissible case. So the defendant can challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s case as soon as the plaintiff has fully presented it. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) (once \u2018\u2018a party has been fully heard on an issue\u2019\u2019 the court can consider directing a verdict). The defendant need not wait until the close of all the evidence, though the motion may be made then as well, or may be renewed then if it was made earlier and denied. C is the best answer here. Powers has presented credible evidence that Vicaro treated her, and that her arm has gotten worse. But if that were enough to establish a claim, doctors would be liable every time a patient had a bad outcome. Recovery for malpractice requires something more: proof that the doctor was negligent, that her treatment fell below the standard of reasonable care. Nothing in the question suggests that Powers presented any evidence to establish what good medical practice required in treatment of Powers\u2019s condition, that Vicaro\u2019s treatment failed to live up to that standard, or that any substandard treatment was the cause of Powers\u2019s loss of use of the arm. Thus, A fails, because the evidence does not suffice to support recovery without a finding that Vicaro was at fault. On the evidence presented, Vicaro may have provided excellent treatment, but still been unable to prevent the loss of use of the arm. Many health problems, alas, remain beyond the power of the medical profession to remedy. Powers bears the burden to produce evidence that Vicaro\u2019s treatment was substandard, that he \u2018\u2018breached the duty of due care,\u2019\u2019 and that the breach caused his damages. Powers can not recover without submitting credible evidence of all the elements of her claim, not just some of them, or a majority, but every element of her cause of action. Here, she put on credible evidence that she suffered damages, evidence that could lead a reasonable jury to find that she has become debilitated. That\u2019s good! But it\u2019s not enough to establish a right to recover, only to prove the damages element of her claim. If the judge allowed Powers\u2019s case to go to the jury on the evidence described, the jury would be licensed to find for her without any proof of a crucial element of her claim. A verdict for her without proof of negligence would be based on legally insufficient evidence. The motion for judgment as a matter of law allows the judge to prevent such legally unsupported verdicts, by refusing to allow the jury to reach them. The \u2018\u2018burden of production/burden of proof\u2019\u2019 terminology is a little confusing. Basically, the judge is acting as a gatekeeper to ensure that only cases that could reasonably be decided in the plaintiff\u2019s favor make it to the jury. If this \u2018\u2018burden of production\u2019\u2019 is met, the jury then decides whether the plaintiff wins. The two \u2018\u2018burdens\u2019\u2019 serve different purposes and are addressed to different participants in the trial. Here\u2019s another question that requires you to sort out these burdens.\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe purpose of the directed verdict motion is to ask the trial judge to take the case away from the jury, on the ground that the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiff.

In a case where the plaintiff\u2019s proof is patently inadequate to establish her claim, the judge has the authority to bar the jury from deciding the case, by \u2018\u2018directing a verdict\u2019\u2019 against her. This older name, \u2018\u2018directed verdict,\u2019\u2019 is suggestive of the motion\u2019s purpose: the judge in a sense orders the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, since no other verdict is supportable on the evidence submitted to them. At one time, judges apparently did literally \u2018\u2018direct the verdict,\u2019\u2019 that is, they ordered the jury in such cases to go out and come back with a verdict for the defendant. These days, the judge simply orders a judgment entered for the defendant. The jury has been empaneled and heard the evidence, but doesn\u2019t get to deliberate and reach a verdict, because the judge has concluded, as a matter of law, that the evidence is too weak to support a plaintiff\u2019s verdict. How can the judge do this? What about the constitutional right to jury trial? Well, that right is generally interpreted to guarantee a jury decision only where there is a legitimate dispute in the evidence, where a meaningful dispute exists about whether the facts the plaintiff must establish are true. If there is such a conflict in the evidence, so that reasonable jurors could find for either party, the jury should resolve that conflict by \u2018\u2018finding the facts.\u2019\u2019 However, if the plaintiff has no evidence, or clearly insufficient evidence, to establish a required element of that claim, courts have held that the jury has no legitimate role to play, because its constitutional role as the finder of facts is not required. See Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72522. If it is clear that the plaintiff cannot establish a required element of her claim, there is no need for the jury to consider the case. Courts often speak of two burdens the plaintiff must carry in order to obtain a valid verdict in her favor. First, she bears the burden to convince the judge that her evidence is strong enough on each element of her claim to support a rational verdict in her favor. This is often referred to as the \u2018\u2018burden of production.\u2019\u2019 To avoid a directed verdict, the plaintiff must produce enough evidence that a jury, acting rationally upon that evidence, could find that the elements she must prove are met. It is the judge who decides whether the plaintiff has met the burden of production. In making that decision, she does not ask whether she, were she the fact finder, would be convinced of the truth of the disputed element. Instead, she must ask whether a jury, looking at that evidence, could rationally be convinced of it, that is, if the decision is in the debatable range. If she concludes that the plaintiff has met the burden of production on each element of her claim, she denies the motion for judgment as a matter of law and sends the case to the jury. If the judge concludes that the plaintiff has satisfied the burden to produce credible evidence on each element of her claim, and lets the case go to the jury, the jury must then decide whether she has met her second burden, the burden to prove her case by a preponderance of the evidence. The judge has concluded that a jury rationally could find for her on the evidence produced. Now the jury must decide whether it will find for her, under a more-probable-than-not standard of proof. The jury\u2019s job is to determine whether she has met the \u2018\u2018burden of proof\u2019\u2019 on each element of her claim, while the judge\u2019s role is to decide whether she has met the less onerous burden to produce credible evidence of those elements. Consider the defendant\u2019s motion in the following example. It\u2019s a negligence case. As you have learned or will learn in Torts, there are four elements to a claim for negligence. To recover for negligence, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant owed her a duty of due care, that the defendant breached that duty, that she suffered damages, and that the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty of due care caused her damages.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Elementary principles. Powers sues Dr. Vicaro in federal court for negligence in medical treatment. The case goes to trial, and the plaintiff presents all of her evidence. That evidence shows that she went to Vicaro with complaints of pain in her arm, that he treated her with various drugs, and that the arm has gotten progressively worse, so that now she can barely use it. Her evidence further shows the damages she has suffered due to the loss of use of the arm, including the loss of her job. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the defendant moves for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe motion should be denied, because it can only be made after the jury deliberates, not before.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet\u2019s quickly dispose of the last choice. D is wrong because, if a plaintiff\u2019s proof is legally insufficient (if she has failed to meet her \u2018\u2018burden of production\u2019\u2019), the judge has the power to order a judgment as a matter of law for the defendant without letting the jury decide the case. True, she could deny the motion, let the jury deliberate and reach a verdict, and then reconsider whether the evidence is sufficient on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). But she also has the authority, under Rule 50(a), to withdraw the case from the jury before it deliberates, by granting judgment as a matter of law. If she does, the jury never will deliberate on the case. B is also incorrect. It suggests that the defendant must wait until the close of all the evidence to challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s case. Under the Federal Rules\u2014and, I\u2019ll wager, under those of most states\u2014the defendant may raise that challenge as soon as the plaintiff has had her full chance to present sufficient evidence to get to the jury. When the plaintiff \u2018\u2018rests her case,\u2019\u2019 that is, announces that she has put on all her evidence, she has had her full opportunity to establish a credible case on each element of her claim. At that point, she has presumably presented everything she\u2019s got to establish breach, causation, and damages,1 so it\u2019s fair to stop the process if, having had that full opportunity, she has failed to produce a submissible case. So the defendant can challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s case as soon as the plaintiff has fully presented it. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) (once \u2018\u2018a party has been fully heard on an issue\u2019\u2019 the court can consider directing a verdict). The defendant need not wait until the close of all the evidence, though the motion may be made then as well, or may be renewed then if it was made earlier and denied. C is the best answer here. Powers has presented credible evidence that Vicaro treated her, and that her arm has gotten worse. But if that were enough to establish a claim, doctors would be liable every time a patient had a bad outcome. Recovery for malpractice requires something more: proof that the doctor was negligent, that her treatment fell below the standard of reasonable care. Nothing in the question suggests that Powers presented any evidence to establish what good medical practice required in treatment of Powers\u2019s condition, that Vicaro\u2019s treatment failed to live up to that standard, or that any substandard treatment was the cause of Powers\u2019s loss of use of the arm. Thus, A fails, because the evidence does not suffice to support recovery without a finding that Vicaro was at fault. On the evidence presented, Vicaro may have provided excellent treatment, but still been unable to prevent the loss of use of the arm. Many health problems, alas, remain beyond the power of the medical profession to remedy. Powers bears the burden to produce evidence that Vicaro\u2019s treatment was substandard, that he \u2018\u2018breached the duty of due care,\u2019\u2019 and that the breach caused his damages. Powers can not recover without submitting credible evidence of all the elements of her claim, not just some of them, or a majority, but every element of her cause of action. Here, she put on credible evidence that she suffered damages, evidence that could lead a reasonable jury to find that she has become debilitated. That\u2019s good! But it\u2019s not enough to establish a right to recover, only to prove the damages element of her claim. If the judge allowed Powers\u2019s case to go to the jury on the evidence described, the jury would be licensed to find for her without any proof of a crucial element of her claim. A verdict for her without proof of negligence would be based on legally insufficient evidence. The motion for judgment as a matter of law allows the judge to prevent such legally unsupported verdicts, by refusing to allow the jury to reach them. The \u2018\u2018burden of production/burden of proof\u2019\u2019 terminology is a little confusing. Basically, the judge is acting as a gatekeeper to ensure that only cases that could reasonably be decided in the plaintiff\u2019s favor make it to the jury. If this \u2018\u2018burden of production\u2019\u2019 is met, the jury then decides whether the plaintiff wins. The two \u2018\u2018burdens\u2019\u2019 serve different purposes and are addressed to different participants in the trial. Here\u2019s another question that requires you to sort out these burdens.\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nThe purpose of the directed verdict motion is to ask the trial judge to take the case away from the jury, on the ground that the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiff.

Nothing in the question suggests that Powers presented any evidence to establish what good medical practice required in treatment of Powers\u2019s condition, that Vicaro\u2019s treatment failed to live up to that standard, or that any substandard treatment was the cause of Powers\u2019s loss of use of the arm. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe purpose of the directed verdict motion is to ask the trial judge to take the case away from the jury, on the ground that the evidence is insufficient to support a verdict for the plaintiff. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) (motion should be granted where there is \u2018\u2018no legally sufficient evidentiary basis\u2019\u2019 for the jury to find for the party opposing the motion). In a case where the plaintiff\u2019s proof is patently inadequate to establish her claim, the judge has the authority to bar the jury from deciding the case, by \u2018\u2018directing a verdict\u2019\u2019 against her. This older name, \u2018\u2018directed verdict,\u2019\u2019 is suggestive of the motion\u2019s purpose: the judge in a sense orders the jury to find a verdict for the defendant, since no other verdict is supportable on the evidence submitted to them. At one time, judges apparently did literally \u2018\u2018direct the verdict,\u2019\u2019 that is, they ordered the jury in such cases to go out and come back with a verdict for the defendant. These days, the judge simply orders a judgment entered for the defendant. The jury has been empaneled and heard the evidence, but doesn\u2019t get to deliberate and reach a verdict, because the judge has concluded, as a matter of law, that the evidence is too weak to support a plaintiff\u2019s verdict. How can the judge do this? What about the constitutional right to jury trial? Well, that right is generally interpreted to guarantee a jury decision only where there is a legitimate dispute in the evidence, where a meaningful dispute exists about whether the facts the plaintiff must establish are true. If there is such a conflict in the evidence, so that reasonable jurors could find for either party, the jury should resolve that conflict by \u2018\u2018finding the facts.\u2019\u2019 However, if the plaintiff has no evidence, or clearly insufficient evidence, to establish a required element of that claim, courts have held that the jury has no legitimate role to play, because its constitutional role as the finder of facts is not required. See Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72522. If it is clear that the plaintiff cannot establish a required element of her claim, there is no need for the jury to consider the case. Courts often speak of two burdens the plaintiff must carry in order to obtain a valid verdict in her favor. First, she bears the burden to convince the judge that her evidence is strong enough on each element of her claim to support a rational verdict in her favor. This is often referred to as the \u2018\u2018burden of production.\u2019\u2019 To avoid a directed verdict, the plaintiff must produce enough evidence that a jury, acting rationally upon that evidence, could find that the elements she must prove are met. It is the judge who decides whether the plaintiff has met the burden of production. In making that decision, she does not ask whether she, were she the fact finder, would be convinced of the truth of the disputed element. Instead, she must ask whether a jury, looking at that evidence, could rationally be convinced of it, that is, if the decision is in the debatable range. If she concludes that the plaintiff has met the burden of production on each element of her claim, she denies the motion for judgment as a matter of law and sends the case to the jury. If the judge concludes that the plaintiff has satisfied the burden to produce credible evidence on each element of her claim, and lets the case go to the jury, the jury must then decide whether she has met her second burden, the burden to prove her case by a preponderance of the evidence. The judge has concluded that a jury rationally could find for her on the evidence produced. Now the jury must decide whether it will find for her, under a more-probable-than-not standard of proof. The jury\u2019s job is to determine whether she has met the \u2018\u2018burden of proof\u2019\u2019 on each element of her claim, while the judge\u2019s role is to decide whether she has met the less onerous burden to produce credible evidence of those elements. Consider the defendant\u2019s motion in the following example. It\u2019s a negligence case. As you have learned or will learn in Torts, there are four elements to a claim for negligence. To recover for negligence, a plaintiff must establish that the defendant owed her a duty of due care, that the defendant breached that duty, that she suffered damages, and that the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty of due care caused her damages.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Elementary principles. Powers sues Dr. Vicaro in federal court for negligence in medical treatment. The case goes to trial, and the plaintiff presents all of her evidence. That evidence shows that she went to Vicaro with complaints of pain in her arm, that he treated her with various drugs, and that the arm has gotten progressively worse, so that now she can barely use it. Her evidence further shows the damages she has suffered due to the loss of use of the arm, including the loss of her job. At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, the defendant moves for judgment as a matter of law under Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThe motion should be denied, because it can only be made after the jury deliberates, not before.\n\nAnalysis:\nLet\u2019s quickly dispose of the last choice. D is wrong because, if a plaintiff\u2019s proof is legally insufficient (if she has failed to meet her \u2018\u2018burden of production\u2019\u2019), the judge has the power to order a judgment as a matter of law for the defendant without letting the jury decide the case. True, she could deny the motion, let the jury deliberate and reach a verdict, and then reconsider whether the evidence is sufficient on a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). But she also has the authority, under Rule 50(a), to withdraw the case from the jury before it deliberates, by granting judgment as a matter of law. If she does, the jury never will deliberate on the case. B is also incorrect. It suggests that the defendant must wait until the close of all the evidence to challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s case. Under the Federal Rules\u2014and, I\u2019ll wager, under those of most states\u2014the defendant may raise that challenge as soon as the plaintiff has had her full chance to present sufficient evidence to get to the jury. When the plaintiff \u2018\u2018rests her case,\u2019\u2019 that is, announces that she has put on all her evidence, she has had her full opportunity to establish a credible case on each element of her claim. At that point, she has presumably presented everything she\u2019s got to establish breach, causation, and damages,1 so it\u2019s fair to stop the process if, having had that full opportunity, she has failed to produce a submissible case. So the defendant can challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s case as soon as the plaintiff has fully presented it. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a) (once \u2018\u2018a party has been fully heard on an issue\u2019\u2019 the court can consider directing a verdict). The defendant need not wait until the close of all the evidence, though the motion may be made then as well, or may be renewed then if it was made earlier and denied. C is the best answer here. Powers has presented credible evidence that Vicaro treated her, and that her arm has gotten worse. But if that were enough to establish a claim, doctors would be liable every time a patient had a bad outcome. Recovery for malpractice requires something more: proof that the doctor was negligent, that her treatment fell below the standard of reasonable care. Nothing in the question suggests that Powers presented any evidence to establish what good medical practice required in treatment of Powers\u2019s condition, that Vicaro\u2019s treatment failed to live up to that standard, or that any substandard treatment was the cause of Powers\u2019s loss of use of the arm. Thus, A fails, because the evidence does not suffice to support recovery without a finding that Vicaro was at fault. On the evidence presented, Vicaro may have provided excellent treatment, but still been unable to prevent the loss of use of the arm. Many health problems, alas, remain beyond the power of the medical profession to remedy. Powers bears the burden to produce evidence that Vicaro\u2019s treatment was substandard, that he \u2018\u2018breached the duty of due care,\u2019\u2019 and that the breach caused his damages. Powers can not recover without submitting credible evidence of all the elements of her claim, not just some of them, or a majority, but every element of her cause of action. Here, she put on credible evidence that she suffered damages, evidence that could lead a reasonable jury to find that she has become debilitated. That\u2019s good! But it\u2019s not enough to establish a right to recover, only to prove the damages element of her claim. If the judge allowed Powers\u2019s case to go to the jury on the evidence described, the jury would be licensed to find for her without any proof of a crucial element of her claim. A verdict for her without proof of negligence would be based on legally insufficient evidence. The motion for judgment as a matter of law allows the judge to prevent such legally unsupported verdicts, by refusing to allow the jury to reach them. The \u2018\u2018burden of production/burden of proof\u2019\u2019 terminology is a little confusing. Basically, the judge is acting as a gatekeeper to ensure that only cases that could reasonably be decided in the plaintiff\u2019s favor make it to the jury. If this \u2018\u2018burden of production\u2019\u2019 is met, the jury then decides whether the plaintiff wins. The two \u2018\u2018burdens\u2019\u2019 serve different purposes and are addressed to different participants in the trial. Here\u2019s another question that requires you to sort out these burdens.\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nSuppose that the losing party at trial believes that she has grounds both to seek a new trial and to seek judgment as a matter of law? (Remember, under Federal Rule 50(b), a motion for judgment as a matter of law after the verdict is the equivalent of the common law motion for \u2018\u2018judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\u2019\u2019) Suppose, for example, in the plane crash case in Question 3, that Knox loses at trial and believes that Sardinha\u2019s evidence of negligence was so weak that the jury\u2019s verdict is irrational. In federal court, she would presumably move for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) on that ground. And, if she views the evidence as that weak, she must also view the jury\u2019s verdict as \u2018\u2018against the great weight of the evidence,\u2019\u2019 a ground for a new trial. And, just to make things more interesting, assume as well that she believes the judge\u2019s instruction on causation was wrong. What should Knox do? Well, what would you do? You would make both motions, of course. Naturally, you would prefer that the judge granted your motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), because then you would win outright. But if she won\u2019t do that, you\u2019d certainly like to live to fight another day, by getting a new trial. Federal Rule 50(c) deals with such combined motions. It requires the judge to rule on both motions. If she is inclined to grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law, she should do so, but, under Rule 50(c)(1), she should also rule \u2018\u2018conditionally\u2019\u2019 on the motion for a new trial as well. For example, she might rule as follows: The defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law is granted, since the jury\u2019s finding that the accident resulted from the negligence of Knox is not supported by sufficient evidence to support a rational verdict. However, in the alternative, I find that the jury\u2019s verdict is also against the great weight of the evidence, and I therefore conditionally grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. However, I deny the motion for a new trial based on the causation instruction, since the instruction given accurately reflects the law in this jurisdiction. The trial judge, by ruling on all the motions, facilitates full appellate review of the case. If there is an appeal, the appellate court can review all of the trial judge\u2019s rulings in a single, consolidated appeal. So, if the judge does rule on both motions, what happens next, and how do the parties obtain appellate review of the judge\u2019s rulings on these motions? Here\u2019s a question that illustrates how these decisions will be reviewed on appeal. (Reading Rule 50(c) will help with it.)\n\nQuestion:\n7. Interim finality. Parkins sues Orwell Corporation in federal court under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act.

Orwell then moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) and in the alternative for a new trial on the ground that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the great weight of the evidence.

Usually, things will work out. If the judge thinks that Pavarotti has failed to meet the burden of production, that his proof is so desperately weak that she is tempted to direct a verdict, the jury will likely conclude that he has not met his burden of proof, the more-probable-than-not standard of proof in a civil case, and return a verdict for Sills anyway. That\u2019s a great outcome from the system\u2019s point of view. Pavarotti will have had every opportunity to prove his case, and will have no complaint that the judge interfered with his right to a jury. And, the party that both the judge and jury think should win did win. If the jury does return a verdict for Pavarotti, the judge has another remedy: she can grant judgment for Sills \u2018\u2018notwithstanding the verdict.\u2019\u2019 That is, she may order a judgment entered for Sills even though the jury rendered a verdict for Pavarotti. Essentially, a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (in federal court, judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b)) is a delayed motion for a directed verdict. The standard for granting the motion after verdict is the same as the standard used if the motion is made before the case goes to the jury, that the evidence is too weak to support a rational verdict for the plaintiff. The difference is timing, and, of course, the fact that the jury has rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, so the judge, by granting the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, is declaring the jury\u2019s verdict insupportable.

What should the appellate court order? In this scenario, the jury deliberated and reached a verdict for Pavarotti. While the judge took that verdict away, the appellate court concludes that she should not have done so. The remedy is easy: Order judgment entered for Pavarotti on the jury\u2019s verdict, assuming there were no other errors in the trial process. A, C, and D are all wrong; by postponing the decision to order judgment for Sills, and getting the jury\u2019s verdict, the trial judge has avoided any need to retry the case. If the appellate court declares that the case was \u2018\u2018jury-worthy,\u2019\u2019 the jury\u2019s verdict is there to resolve the case. The trial court will be ordered to enter judgment for Pavarotti on that verdict.\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nSuppose that the losing party at trial believes that she has grounds both to seek a new trial and to seek judgment as a matter of law? (Remember, under Federal Rule 50(b), a motion for judgment as a matter of law after the verdict is the equivalent of the common law motion for \u2018\u2018judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\u2019\u2019) Suppose, for example, in the plane crash case in Question 3, that Knox loses at trial and believes that Sardinha\u2019s evidence of negligence was so weak that the jury\u2019s verdict is irrational. In federal court, she would presumably move for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) on that ground. And, if she views the evidence as that weak, she must also view the jury\u2019s verdict as \u2018\u2018against the great weight of the evidence,\u2019\u2019 a ground for a new trial. And, just to make things more interesting, assume as well that she believes the judge\u2019s instruction on causation was wrong. What should Knox do? Well, what would you do? You would make both motions, of course. Naturally, you would prefer that the judge granted your motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b), because then you would win outright. But if she won\u2019t do that, you\u2019d certainly like to live to fight another day, by getting a new trial. Federal Rule 50(c) deals with such combined motions. It requires the judge to rule on both motions. If she is inclined to grant the motion for judgment as a matter of law, she should do so, but, under Rule 50(c)(1), she should also rule \u2018\u2018conditionally\u2019\u2019 on the motion for a new trial as well. For example, she might rule as follows: The defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law is granted, since the jury\u2019s finding that the accident resulted from the negligence of Knox is not supported by sufficient evidence to support a rational verdict. However, in the alternative, I find that the jury\u2019s verdict is also against the great weight of the evidence, and I therefore conditionally grant the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. However, I deny the motion for a new trial based on the causation instruction, since the instruction given accurately reflects the law in this jurisdiction. The trial judge, by ruling on all the motions, facilitates full appellate review of the case. If there is an appeal, the appellate court can review all of the trial judge\u2019s rulings in a single, consolidated appeal. So, if the judge does rule on both motions, what happens next, and how do the parties obtain appellate review of the judge\u2019s rulings on these motions? Here\u2019s a question that illustrates how these decisions will be reviewed on appeal. (Reading Rule 50(c) will help with it.)\n\nQuestion:\n7. Interim finality. Parkins sues Orwell Corporation in federal court under the Federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act. At trial, Orwell moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a) before the case goes to the jury. The motion is denied. The jury finds for Parkins. Orwell then moves for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) and in the alternative for a new trial on the ground that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the great weight of the evidence. The judge grants Orwell\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, and conditionally grants the motion for a new trial as well, on the ground that the verdict is against the great weight of the evidence.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nParkins may appeal both orders, since a final judgment will enter for Orwell.\n\nAnalysis:\nA takes the cake\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe trial judge can avoid the scenario just described by holding her fire, denying the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(a), and letting the jury deliberate, even if she views Pavarotti\u2019s case as too weak to support a rational verdict. Usually, things will work out. If the judge thinks that Pavarotti has failed to meet the burden of production, that his proof is so desperately weak that she is tempted to direct a verdict, the jury will likely conclude that he has not met his burden of proof, the more-probable-than-not standard of proof in a civil case, and return a verdict for Sills anyway. That\u2019s a great outcome from the system\u2019s point of view. Pavarotti will have had every opportunity to prove his case, and will have no complaint that the judge interfered with his right to a jury. And, the party that both the judge and jury think should win did win. If the jury does return a verdict for Pavarotti, the judge has another remedy: she can grant judgment for Sills \u2018\u2018notwithstanding the verdict.\u2019\u2019 That is, she may order a judgment entered for Sills even though the jury rendered a verdict for Pavarotti. Essentially, a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (in federal court, judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b)) is a delayed motion for a directed verdict. The standard for granting the motion after verdict is the same as the standard used if the motion is made before the case goes to the jury, that the evidence is too weak to support a rational verdict for the plaintiff. The difference is timing, and, of course, the fact that the jury has rendered a verdict for the plaintiff, so the judge, by granting the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, is declaring the jury\u2019s verdict insupportable. While this is awkward, it has the distinct advantage illustrated below.\n\nQuestion:\n6. Your verdict or mine? Assume, on the facts of Question 3 (the first Sills hypo on p. 442) that the trial judge denied Sills\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence. The case went to the jury, which returned a verdict for Pavarotti. Sills then moves for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and the judge grants the motion, on the ground that the evidence was too weak to support a finding that she was the driver who hit Pavarotti. Pavarotti appeals. If the appeals court concludes that the evidence was sufficient to support a rational inference that Sills was the driver, it will\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nreverse the entry of judgment for Sills and order a full new trial.\n\nAnalysis:\nHere, the judge allows the case to go to the jury, it finds for the plaintiff, the judge takes the verdict away on the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and the appellate court reverses, concluding that Pavarotti had satisfied the burden of production after all. What should the appellate court order? In this scenario, the jury deliberated and reached a verdict for Pavarotti.

Respect for the first court\u2019s authority, the parties\u2019 reliance on settled rights, and the need to conserve judicial resources all support a refusal of the second court\u2014either the same court that originally decided the case or another court\u2014to relitigate it. However, fairness suggests that a party should only be precluded from litigating a claim in a second action if she litigated it in the first action, or was entitled to litigate it there. Claim preclusion would deprive a party of due process of law if it barred a court from considering a claim in a second action that the party could not have presented in the first. Thus, in determining what claims are barred by claim preclusion in a second action, it is important to know what claims could have been\u2014or could not have been\u2014asserted in the first. Today, most procedural systems allow much broader joinder of claims than courts did a hundred years ago. In the federal courts, and in many state court systems as well, a plaintiff may join any claims she has against a defendant, even if they are based on different theories or seek different types of relief. Under earlier procedural rules, plaintiffs were much more constricted in joining claims. They might, for example, under the common law \u2018\u2018forms of action,\u2019\u2019 have been barred from joining claims based on different types of legal theories, such as tort and contract. They might also have had to seek different types of relief, such as money damages or equitable relief (an injunction, rescission of a contract, or an accounting, for example) from different courts. Here\u2019s a simple example to illustrate the relationship between the scope of joinder under civil procedure rules and the operation of claim preclusion.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Ruin and res judicata. Mulligan hires DeLay to restore his 1933 Rolls Royce, but claims that DeLay ruined it rather than restored it. He sues DeLay in the state courts of Emporia. The State of Emporia does not jump at fancy new concepts, like the unified civil action recognized in Rule 2 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It remains content with the old common law forms of action. Under Emporia procedure, a plaintiff who brings suit under a writ of assumpsit may assert any contract claims she has against the defendant, even for breach of two unrelated contracts. However, she could not assert claims based on a tort theory under a writ of assumpsit, even if the tort claim arose out of the same underlying facts as the contract claim. Mulligan brings an action in assumpsit against DeLay, seeking damages for breach of contract for the work on the Rolls. Mulligan\u2019s action is dismissed on a motion for summary judgment, on the ground that his contract is unenforceable under the Emporia statute of frauds. A final judgment enters for DeLay. Shortly thereafter, Mulligan brings a new action against DeLay, based on the writ of trespass on the case, alleging that his negligent work on the Rolls rendered it worthless. Under Emporia procedure, an action on the case allows assertion of claims based on negligence. Mulligan\u2019s second action will probably\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nnot be barred, because he could not have asserted it in the first action.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo B is right. Where a party leaves out a claim because it could not be included, claim preclusion will not bar a second action on that claim. Under modern procedure, this will rarely happen.

Since the right to join such claims is broad, the bar on later actions based on that dispute is equally broad.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nA frequent claim preclusion scenario involves a plaintiff who sues in federal court on federal claims, and then brings a later action in state court on related state law claims. This scenario is different from the previous examples, because it involves a court in one system determining what res judicata effect to give to the decision of a court in a different system. These \u2018\u2018intersystem preclusion\u2019\u2019 issues can be complex.

Similarly, a federal court, confronted with a second action after a previous action in state court, will apply the claim preclusion rules of the state court that rendered the previous decision.

On that premise, consider the following two examples. Keep in mind that the federal courts follow the Second Restatement approach to claim preclusion problems.\n\nQuestion:\n7. Round One. Pelham sues Correro, a police officer who arrested him. He brings suit in federal court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, a federal statute that authorizes suits against persons acting on behalf of the state for violation of federal civil rights. Pelham alleges that Correro\u2019s conduct in using excessive force in making the arrest violated his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He loses, because the federal court determines that Correro is entitled to qualified immunity from liability on the federal civil rights claim. Subsequently, Pelham sues Correro in state court for assault and battery, based on the same conduct that gave rise to his federal civil rights action. Assume that the state court uses a narrower, \u2018\u2018primary rights\u2019\u2019 approach to claim preclusion, that the assault and battery claims, under that approach, would be viewed as based on different primary rights from the federal civil rights claim and could be brought in a separate action. Pelham\u2019s second action\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nwill not be barred, because he did not assert his state law claims in the initial suit.\n\nAnalysis:\n A is wrong too, because preclusion under the transactional approach does not turn on whether the omitted claim was joined, but on whether it could have been joined. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nIt is commonly said that res judicata only applies if the judgment in the prior action was rendered on the merits of the case. This requirement is deceiving, however, since a party is frequently precluded from relitigating even though she never litigated anything \u2018\u2018on the merits\u2019\u2019 in the prior action. The point of the \u2018\u2018on the merits\u2019\u2019 requirement is to prevent courts from giving claim preclusive effect to certain procedural dismissals of the first action. For example, if Reynoso sues in federal court, and her case is dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, no court would bar her from suing on the same claim in state court. She never had a full opportunity to have her case heard in the first action. Indeed, the court\u2019s reason for dismissal was that it could not hear the claim. As we saw at the outset of the chapter, where a legal theory can\u2019t be asserted in the first action, a second action on that theory will not be barred. So dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and similarly, for lack of personal jurisdiction or improper venue, are not viewed as \u2018\u2018on the merits,\u2019\u2019 and do not preclude a second action in another court competent to entertain the claim. In other situations, however, dismissals that clearly do not involve litigation of the claim itself do bar a second action, even though we would not think of them as decisions \u2018\u2018on the merits.\u2019\u2019 (For this reason, the Second Restatement shies away from the phrase entirely.) If a defendant fails to respond to the suit, for example, and judgment is entered by default for the plaintiff, there has clearly been no litigation on the merits. Yet most courts give res judicata effect to a default judgment. That is, they would not allow the defendant, having abandoned his opportunity to defend in Suit One, to try to relitigate the transaction later. The rationale is that the defendant had the opportunity to litigate in Suit One, and is not entitled to ignore the pending action in favor of another action later at a time and place of his own choosing. On the same rationale, a plaintiff who files an action and does not pursue it, leading to a \u2018\u2018dismissal for failure to prosecute,\u2019\u2019 will be barred from bringing a second action. If litigation was commenced, and there was no procedural impediment to prevent the court from hearing it, the parties have had their opportunity to litigate and should either grasp it or recognize that they have waived it. In some cases, the parties may reach the merits but not go to trial. For example, a claim may be resolved on summary judgment, when the court finds that there is no dispute of material fact and one of the parties is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Or, a case may be dismissed at the outset for \u2018\u2018failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\u2019\u2019 In both of these situations, the court has concluded that the plaintiff cannot recover, though neither involves a trial. Virtually all courts would give claim preclusive effect to a summary judgment, and a good many treat the dismissal of a case under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (or similar state court rules) for failure to state a claim as a bar to a new action. When a complaint is dismissed for failure to state a claim, the plaintiff will be given the opportunity to replead, to try to state a compensable claim for relief. She may also seek to dismiss the action \u2018\u2018without prejudice,\u2019\u2019 that is, with express recognition by the court that the dismissal of the first action will not bar another suit on the same claim. If the plaintiff takes neither of these avenues to avoid the demise of her claim, it is probably because she cannot state one. Consider whether the second claim would be barred in the following example.\n\nQuestion:\n5. Procedure and substance. Akbar sues Rajiv Motors in an Emporia court for injuries suffered while driving a used snowmobile that Rajiv had sold to him. His suit is based on breach of warranty (a contract theory) and strict products liability, a tort theory. Rajiv moves to dismiss the contracts claim, on the ground that the Emporia long-arm statute does not authorize jurisdiction over it. The judge concludes that the long-arm statute allows suit against Rajiv for tort claims, but not contract claims, and dismisses the breach of warranty claim. The case goes to trial on the strict liability claim. After Akbar presents his evidence, the trial judge grants a directed verdict for Rajiv, on the ground that Akbar has not presented sufficient evidence that the snowmobile was defective. Judgment is entered for Rajiv. Later, Akbar sues Rajiv again, for the same injuries, again in the Emporia courts. He bases his claim in this action on a negligence theory.

That is, they would not allow the defendant, having abandoned his opportunity to defend in Suit One, to try to relitigate the transaction later. The rationale is that the defendant had the opportunity to litigate in Suit One, and is not entitled to ignore the pending action in favor of another action later at a time and place of his own choosing.

Thus, claim preclusion will apply to bar the negligence claim here. A is right.\n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nArticle III, \u00a72 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases \u2018\u2018arising under\u2019\u2019 federal law. And 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, the statute conveying arising-under jurisdiction to the federal district courts, uses the same language. A student, or a lawyer, might reasonably conclude that this language means the same thing in the statute and in the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase \u2018\u2018arising under federal law\u2019\u2019 in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, shouldn\u2019t that phrase mean the same thing in Article III, \u00a72? Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. If the Mottley rule were an interpretation of Article III, it would drastically restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases that involve federal defenses and counterclaims. For example, the Court would have no power to hear an appeal in a case like Consolidated\u2019s in Question 1, which raises a federal issue, but does not satisfy the Mottley test. The state courts would then have the final authority to decide the federal law questions raised by the case. Not surprisingly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the scope of the Article III arising-under jurisdiction much more broadly than Mottley\u2019s construction of the arising-under statute. In Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. 738 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of the case. Certainly, federal law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of a case if a federal issue is raised as a defense or as a counterclaim. Thus, because the Article III grant extends to such cases, Congress could do away with the Mottley rule (what law student would miss it?) by amending 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. Although this has been clear since Osborn, Congress has never repudiated Mottley, because it provides a clear rule that allows federal courts to determine their jurisdiction at the outset of the case, and limits the potential for parties to manipulate federal jurisdiction. To illustrate the distinction between the reach of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III and under \u00a71331, consider the following question.\n\nQuestion:\n5. Mix and match. Eleanor sues Franklin for breach of contract, claiming that he agreed to sell her certain high-risk securities on January 1, 2011, but failed to deliver them on the appointed date. Franklin defends on the ground that after he agreed to the sale, but before the delivery date, a federal statute was passed making such sales illegal.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThis case \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law as that phrase is construed in Article III, \u00a72 of the United States Constitution, but not as construed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo C is the right answer. The case is within the constitutional grant of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III: Franklin\u2019s federal law defense makes federal law an \u2018\u2018ingredient\u2019\u2019 of the case, even though that ingredient is injected by the defendant, not the plaintiff. But the case is not proper under \u00a71331, because Mottley\u2019s well-pleaded complaint rule (still the governing interpretation of \u00a71332(a)) requires that the plaintiff rely on federal law to make her claim. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nArticle III, \u00a72 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases \u2018\u2018arising under\u2019\u2019 federal law.

The facts here are essentially a clone of Mottley. The plaintiff sues under state contract law, and the defendant asserts a federal defense to the claim. This is clearly not an arising-under case under the Mottley interpretation of \u00a71331, because the plaintiff\u2019s well-pleaded complaint asserts only a state law claim. So A and B are both wrong: In order to satisfy the arising-under statute, \u00a71331, the plaintiff herself must assert a right to relief under federal law, and Eleanor\u2019s claim is based on state contract law.1 And since, under Mottley, the court will only look at the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, not at the answer, in determining whether it has jurisdiction under \u00a71331, \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nArticle III, \u00a72 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases \u2018\u2018arising under\u2019\u2019 federal law.

Bank of the United States, 22 U.S. 738 (1824), Chief Justice Marshall concluded that the Article III grant of jurisdiction over cases arising under federal law applies as long as a question of federal statutory or constitutional law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of the case. Certainly, federal law \u2018\u2018forms an ingredient\u2019\u2019 of a case if a federal issue is raised as a defense or as a counterclaim. Thus, because the Article III grant extends to such cases, Congress could do away with the Mottley rule (what law student would miss it?) by amending 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331. Although this has been clear since Osborn, Congress has never repudiated Mottley, because it provides a clear rule that allows federal courts to determine their jurisdiction at the outset of the case, and limits the potential for parties to manipulate federal jurisdiction. To illustrate the distinction between the reach of arising-under jurisdiction in Article III and under \u00a71331, consider the following question.\n\nQuestion:\n5. Mix and match. Eleanor sues Franklin for breach of contract, claiming that he agreed to sell her certain high-risk securities on January 1, 2011, but failed to deliver them on the appointed date. Franklin defends on the ground that after he agreed to the sale, but before the delivery date, a federal statute was passed making such sales illegal.\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nThis case \u2018\u2018arises under\u2019\u2019 federal law as that phrase is construed in Article III, \u00a72 of the United States Constitution, but not as construed in 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo C is the right answer.

But the case is not proper under \u00a71331, because Mottley\u2019s well-pleaded complaint rule (still the governing interpretation of \u00a71332(a)) requires that the plaintiff rely on federal law to make her claim. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nArticle III, \u00a72 of the Constitution provides that federal courts may hear cases \u2018\u2018arising under\u2019\u2019 federal law. And 28 U.S.C. \u00a71331, the statute conveying arising-under jurisdiction to the federal district courts, uses the same language. A student, or a lawyer, might reasonably conclude that this language means the same thing in the statute and in the Constitution. Since the Supreme Court has interpreted the phrase \u2018\u2018arising under federal law\u2019\u2019 in the statute to focus solely on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, shouldn\u2019t that phrase mean the same thing in Article III, \u00a72? Article III defines the constitutional limits of the jurisdiction of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court. If the Mottley rule were an interpretation of Article III, it would drastically restrict the power of all federal courts, including the Supreme Court, to consider cases that involve federal defenses and counterclaims. For example, the Court would have no power to hear an appeal in a case like Consolidated\u2019s in Question 1, which raises a federal issue, but does not satisfy the Mottley test. The state courts would then have the final authority to decide the federal law questions raised by the case.

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71446(b)(1), the notice of removal must be filed within thirty days \u2018\u2018after receipt by the defendant, through service or otherwise, of a copy of the initial pleading setting forth the claim for relief. . . .\u2019\u2019 There\u2019s a reason for this short window to remove a case. The state court needs to know whether it is going to hear the case or not. Under \u00a71446(b)(1), the case will either be bumped into federal court within thirty days, or the state court will know that the case won\u2019t be removed, that it has jurisdiction, and can get down to business. But there is an exception. Sometimes a case filed in state court is not removable, but becomes removable later. For example, McCoy, a Mississippi plaintiff, might sue Caswell, a Mississippi defendant, on a state law claim. The case can\u2019t be removed, since there is neither diversity nor a claim under federal law. But later McCoy might amend the complaint to assert a federal claim. Amendments are generally freely allowed, at least in the early stages of the litigation, so this is a realistic possibility. Once the amendment is allowed, the case contains a claim arising under federal law. If it had been filed in this form initially, it would have been removable. Can the defendant remove after the amendment? Another example: McCoy, a Mississippi plaintiff, sues Gupta, a Texas defendant, on a state law claim, for $200,000, and sues Caswell, a Mississippi defendant, as a co-defendant in the action. This case is not removable, since there is no complete diversity. But suppose that later McCoy dismisses her claim against Caswell? Now the case has become a diversity case. Can the defendant remove? In such cases, the statute allows removal once the case becomes removable. Section 1446(b)(3) provides that, if the action wasn\u2019t removable as originally filed, it can be removed within thirty days after the defendant receives notice of an amended pleading or order that makes the action removable. This is an important provision, which reduces the incentive for the plaintiff to play games with the jurisdictional rules. Without this provision in \u00a71446(b), the plaintiff could file the case in a nonremovable form, let the thirty-day period for removal run, and then amend her complaint to assert a claim under federal law. The defendant would be stuck in state court in a case in which the plaintiff intended all along to seek recovery under federal law. But under \u00a71446(b)(3), this ploy won\u2019t work; once the amendment is allowed, adding a claim arising under federal law, and the defendant receives notice of that amendment, she will have thirty days to remove the now-removable action to federal court. Here\u2019s an interesting question on the application of \u00a71446(b)(3).\n\nQuestion:\n3. Professor\u2019s delight. Diversified Investments, Inc., an investment corporation, sues Eagleton for breach of contract, to collect $300,000 due on a margin account she had with Diversified. Diversified is incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in Colorado. It has a large office in Salt Lake City, Utah. Diversified brings the action in Colorado. Eagleton, a Utah citizen, answers the complaint, denying that she owes anything on the account. Four months later, Diversified moves to amend its complaint to add a claim against Eagleton under a federal fraud statute, based on misrepresentations Eagleton allegedly made in establishing her margin account. The motion is granted. Two weeks later, Eagleton removes the action to federal court. Diversified moves to remand the case to state court. The motion to remand should be\n\nAnswer Candidate:\ngranted, because Eagleton did not remove the action within thirty days after the action was filed.\n\nAnalysis:\nSo, the answer is B. The action should be remanded because it was not removed within thirty days of the original filing. This question is a \u2018\u2018professor\u2019s delight,\u2019\u2019 because, while it is fair, it is tricky. The question focuses the student on the amendment adding the federal claim, and invites her to overlook the crucial fact that Eagleton could have removed earlier and did not. Remember the comment that the multistate bar exam (which is all multiple choice) is \u2018\u2018an exercise in reading comprehension.\u2019\u2019 Here\u2019s a good example of that. You might know the law, or be capable of solving this problem by careful reading of \u00a71446(b)(3) (remember, I\u2019m assuming that you have the statutes in front of you in answering these questions), but miss the point by a mile if you don\u2019t analyze the question carefully.

Under \u00a71446(b)(1), the case will either be bumped into federal court within thirty days, or the state court will know that the case won\u2019t be removed, that it has jurisdiction, and can get down to business. But there is an exception. Sometimes a case filed in state court is not removable, but becomes removable later. For example, McCoy, a Mississippi plaintiff, might sue Caswell, a Mississippi defendant, on a state law claim. The case can\u2019t be removed, since there is neither diversity nor a claim under federal law. But later McCoy might amend the complaint to assert a federal claim. Amendments are generally freely allowed, at least in the early stages of the litigation, so this is a realistic possibility. Once the amendment is allowed, the case contains a claim arising under federal law. If it had been filed in this form initially, it would have been removable. Can the defendant remove after the amendment? Another example: McCoy, a Mississippi plaintiff, sues Gupta, a Texas defendant, on a state law claim, for $200,000, and sues Caswell, a Mississippi defendant, as a co-defendant in the action. This case is not removable, since there is no complete diversity. But suppose that later McCoy dismisses her claim against Caswell? Now the case has become a diversity case. Can the defendant remove? In such cases, the statute allows removal once the case becomes removable. Section 1446(b)(3) provides that, if the action wasn\u2019t removable as originally filed, it can be removed within thirty days after the defendant receives notice of an amended pleading or order that makes the action removable. This is an important provision, which reduces the incentive for the plaintiff to play games with the jurisdictional rules. Without this provision in \u00a71446(b), the plaintiff could file the case in a nonremovable form, let the thirty-day period for removal run, and then amend her complaint to assert a claim under federal law. The defendant would be stuck in state court in a case in which the plaintiff intended all along to seek recovery under federal law. But under \u00a71446(b)(3), this ploy won\u2019t work; once the amendment is allowed, adding a claim arising under federal law, and the defendant receives notice of that amendment, she will have thirty days to remove the now-removable action to federal court.

Diversified Investments, Inc., an investment corporation, sues Eagleton for breach of contract, to collect $300,000 due on a margin account she had with Diversified.

Eagleton, a Utah citizen, answers the complaint, denying that she owes anything on the account. Four months later, Diversified moves to amend its complaint to add a claim against Eagleton under a federal fraud statute, based on misrepresentations Eagleton allegedly made in establishing her margin account.

The question focuses the student on the amendment adding the federal claim, and invites her to overlook the crucial fact that Eagleton could have removed earlier and did not. Remember the comment that the multistate bar exam (which is all multiple choice) is \u2018\u2018an exercise in reading comprehension.\u2019\u2019 Here\u2019s a good example of that. You might know the law, or be capable of solving this problem by careful reading of \u00a71446(b)(3) (remember, I\u2019m assuming that you have the statutes in front of you in answering these questions), but miss the point by a mile if you don\u2019t analyze the question carefully.

It has jurisdiction over Antril\u2019s claim against Manello based on diversity, and her claim against Acme because it seeks relief under federal law.2\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe early law of personal jurisdiction, represented by Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714 (1877), based personal jurisdiction on physical power over the defendant, at least in cases against individuals. The logic was that a court had the authority to exert physical power over a defendant within the territory of the state where the court sat. The court could order a sheriff to seize and detain the defendant if he found her within the state. So, the logic proceeded, if the sheriff asserted that authority symbolically, by serving the defendant with process in the state, rather than actually arresting her, the court would acquire jurisdiction to adjudicate the claim and could enter a judgment against her if she were found liable. Here\u2019s a quick example to illustrate Pennoyer\u2019s \u2018\u2018presence theory\u2019\u2019 of personal jurisdiction.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Gone, but not forgotten. Neff hired Mitchell, a lawyer, in Oregon to sue Jones for breach of contract. Neff agreed to pay Mitchell $300 for his services. Mitchell did the work, but Neff left the state for California and didn\u2019t pay Mitchell\u2019s fee. Mitchell sues Neff for his fee in an Oregon state court, and has Neff served with process in Oregon while Neff was visiting there on unrelated business. Neff promptly departed once more for California and has not returned to the state since. Under personal jurisdiction theory as expounded in Pennoyer, the Oregon court\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nhas jurisdiction over Neff for the fees claim, but would not have jurisdiction over him if Mitchell had sued him for a claim that arose in another state.\n\nAnalysis:\nD also comes up short. It suggests that jurisdiction could be based on service of process in the state, but that the court would only acquire jurisdiction by in-state service to adjudicate claims that arose within the state. This is another misconception. If Mitchell filed suit in Oregon, and served Neff with the papers for that suit in Oregon, it didn\u2019t matter what the claim was for. It could be for an auto accident in Maine, a property dispute in Texas, or lies told about him in Minnesota. Jurisdiction was not based on any relation between the claim and the state; it was based on the premise that the court could exert judicial power over a person physically present there. (After all, if Neff never came back to Oregon, Mitchell would have to sue him in California under Pennoyer\u2019s approach, and the California court would then exercise jurisdiction over Neff, even though the claim Mitchell sued upon arose in Oregon.) \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nRule 12 lays several traps for the unwary defendant.

The Fourteenth Amendment bars a state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property \u2018\u2018without due process of law,\u2019\u2019 that is, without a basically fair procedure. If it\u2019s a court that\u2019s doing the depriving\u2014by entering a judgment against a person and forcing her to pay it\u2014basic fairness requires that the defendant have some relationship to the state where the court sits that will make it fair to conduct the litigation there. In civil procedure terms, that means that the court must have \u2018\u2018a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 over the defendant. In the major personal jurisdiction cases, such as International Shoe, World-Wide Volkswagen, Daimler, Asahi, Burnham v. Superior Court, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, the United States Supreme Court has provided some guidance as to the types of relations to a state that will support the exercise of jurisdiction. Some relations that satisfy due process under the Fourteenth Amendment include domicile in a state,1 being \u2018\u2018at home\u2019\u2019 in a state,2 minimum contacts that give rise to the claim,3 and service of process on an individual in the forum state.4 That\u2019s not an exhaustive list, and of course there are refinements and ambiguities, but the point is that the Supreme Court has upheld certain relations to a state as sufficient under the Fourteenth Amendment to support personal jurisdiction over a defendant there. However, it is not enough that a defendant has a contact with the state that is sufficient under the Due Process Clause to allow the state to exert jurisdiction over him. The state must also have a statute that authorizes the court to exercise that jurisdiction. This is confusing; if the exercise of jurisdiction is constitutionally permissible, why does the legislature have to authorize it in a statute too? The reason is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not actually confer jurisdiction on courts. It sets limits on the exercise of jurisdiction. (\u2018\u2018No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u2019\u2019) It says to the states, \u2018\u2018go ahead, define your courts\u2019 jurisdiction as you like, but in doing so, don\u2019t overreach.\u2019\u2019 It is the state legislatures that define the power of their courts to exercise personal jurisdiction. So, when a defendant is sued in the courts of California, the California court must ask whether a California statute authorizes it to assert jurisdiction over that defendant. If the suit is in Wisconsin, the court will look to Wisconsin personal jurisdiction statutes,5 and so on. Thus, two requirements must be met before the court can proceed to adjudicate the defendant\u2019s rights. The court must be authorized to exercise jurisdiction by statute, and it must be constitutionally permissible, under due process analysis, for the court to exercise that statutory authority. Thus, courts address challenges to personal jurisdiction in two steps. First, they ask whether a statute of the state (such as a long-arm statute) authorizes the court to exert jurisdiction over the defendant. Second, if there is statutory authority to exercise jurisdiction, the court proceeds to the second question: whether applying the statute, in the particular circumstances of the case, would assert jurisdiction beyond the bounds permitted by the Due Process Clause.

This dangerously misconstrues the relation of jurisdictional statutes and constitutional constraints. Although it would be consistent with due process for Acadia to require Margules to defend this case in Acadia, it has chosen not to require him to. Instead, it has written a long-arm statute that does not \u2018\u2018reach to the limits of due process.\u2019\u2019 In this long-arm provision, Acadia has granted its courts less personal jurisdiction authority than it constitutionally could, by excluding cases like Perrone\u2019s, in which communications from outside the state defame a plaintiff in the state.

The Fourteenth Amendment bars a state from depriving a person of life, liberty or property \u2018\u2018without due process of law,\u2019\u2019 that is, without a basically fair procedure. If it\u2019s a court that\u2019s doing the depriving\u2014by entering a judgment against a person and forcing her to pay it\u2014basic fairness requires that the defendant have some relationship to the state where the court sits that will make it fair to conduct the litigation there. In civil procedure terms, that means that the court must have \u2018\u2018a basis to exercise personal jurisdiction\u2019\u2019 over the defendant. In the major personal jurisdiction cases, such as International Shoe, World-Wide Volkswagen, Daimler, Asahi, Burnham v. Superior Court, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, the United States Supreme Court has provided some guidance as to the types of relations to a state that will support the exercise of jurisdiction. Some relations that satisfy due process under the Fourteenth Amendment include domicile in a state,1 being \u2018\u2018at home\u2019\u2019 in a state,2 minimum contacts that give rise to the claim,3 and service of process on an individual in the forum state.4 That\u2019s not an exhaustive list, and of course there are refinements and ambiguities, but the point is that the Supreme Court has upheld certain relations to a state as sufficient under the Fourteenth Amendment to support personal jurisdiction over a defendant there. However, it is not enough that a defendant has a contact with the state that is sufficient under the Due Process Clause to allow the state to exert jurisdiction over him. The state must also have a statute that authorizes the court to exercise that jurisdiction. This is confusing; if the exercise of jurisdiction is constitutionally permissible, why does the legislature have to authorize it in a statute too? The reason is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not actually confer jurisdiction on courts. It sets limits on the exercise of jurisdiction. (\u2018\u2018No state shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u2019\u2019) It says to the states, \u2018\u2018go ahead, define your courts\u2019 jurisdiction as you like, but in doing so, don\u2019t overreach.\u2019\u2019 It is the state legislatures that define the power of their courts to exercise personal jurisdiction. So, when a defendant is sued in the courts of California, the California court must ask whether a California statute authorizes it to assert jurisdiction over that defendant. If the suit is in Wisconsin, the court will look to Wisconsin personal jurisdiction statutes,5 and so on. Thus, two requirements must be met before the court can proceed to adjudicate the defendant\u2019s rights. The court must be authorized to exercise jurisdiction by statute, and it must be constitutionally permissible, under due process analysis, for the court to exercise that statutory authority. Thus, courts address challenges to personal jurisdiction in two steps. First, they ask whether a statute of the state (such as a long-arm statute) authorizes the court to exert jurisdiction over the defendant. Second, if there is statutory authority to exercise jurisdiction, the court proceeds to the second question: whether applying the statute, in the particular circumstances of the case, would assert jurisdiction beyond the bounds permitted by the Due Process Clause. Consider the following example on the relation between statutory requirements and constitutional constraints.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Bad words. Perrone, an Acadia resident, sues Margules, a Montanan, in an Acadia state court, for defamation. He claims that Margules called Acme Corporation, an Acadia company that was planning to hire Perrone, and made false and defamatory statements about his professional abilities that led Acme to decide not to hire him. Margules placed the call from her office in Montana.

This dangerously misconstrues the relation of jurisdictional statutes and constitutional constraints. Although it would be consistent with due process for Acadia to require Margules to defend this case in Acadia, it has chosen not to require him to. Instead, it has written a long-arm statute that does not \u2018\u2018reach to the limits of due process.\u2019\u2019 In this long-arm provision, Acadia has granted its courts less personal jurisdiction authority than it constitutionally could, by excluding cases like Perrone\u2019s, in which communications from outside the state defame a plaintiff in the state. Maybe it just doesn\u2019t want to hear all these cases.

You\u2019d feel the same way. \u2018\u2018Hey, wait! This case doesn\u2019t belong here; throw it out.\u2019\u2019 All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court\u2019s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019 The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have \u2018\u2018appeared generally,\u2019\u2019 waiving her special appearance and accepting the court\u2019s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \u2018\u2018special appearance\u2019\u2019 had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\u2019s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\u2019s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here\u2019s a question to test the point. I\u2019ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you\u2019ve read the discussion above it should be easy.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Something special. Ito, a stockbroker, lives and works in Massachusetts, a state that has modeled its rules of procedure after the Federal Rules. He is served in Massachusetts with the complaint and summons in an action Ervin has brought against him in a Nevada court, seeking recovery for misrepresentation in the sale of stock. Assume that Nevada requires a defendant to challenge jurisdiction through the traditional special appearance. Ito\u2019s attorney files a special appearance in the Nevada court objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. A week later, while the objection is pending, he files a motion to dismiss claiming that the case was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations. The court would\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nconclude that Ito had waived his objection to personal jurisdiction by raising the limitations issue.\n\nAnalysis:\nB is the best answer. By the procedural faux pas of asserting the limitations objection, Ito has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction and the court will proceed to hear the case. It is true that, if Ito\u2019s lawyer had filed the same two objections in a state that uses the Federal Rules approach, his objection to personal jurisdiction would not be waived. But he didn\u2019t.

Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \u2018\u2018special appearance\u2019\u2019 had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\u2019s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\u2019s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here\u2019s a question to test the point. I\u2019ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you\u2019ve read the discussion above it should be easy.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Something special. Ito, a stockbroker, lives and works in Massachusetts, a state that has modeled its rules of procedure after the Federal Rules. He is served in Massachusetts with the complaint and summons in an action Ervin has brought against him in a Nevada court, seeking recovery for misrepresentation in the sale of stock. Assume that Nevada requires a defendant to challenge jurisdiction through the traditional special appearance. Ito\u2019s attorney files a special appearance in the Nevada court objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. A week later, while the objection is pending, he files a motion to dismiss claiming that the case was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations. The court would\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nconclude that Ito had waived his objection to personal jurisdiction by raising the limitations issue.\n\nAnalysis:\nB is the best answer. By the procedural faux pas of asserting the limitations objection, Ito has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction and the court will proceed to hear the case. It is true that, if Ito\u2019s lawyer had filed the same two objections in a state that uses the Federal Rules approach, his objection to personal jurisdiction would not be waived. But he didn\u2019t. The special appearance approach is more restrictive, and when in Nevada, you have to do as the Nevadans do.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she\u2019s been sued in the wrong court is to protest. You\u2019d feel the same way. \u2018\u2018Hey, wait! This case doesn\u2019t belong here; throw it out.\u2019\u2019 All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court\u2019s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019 The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate it.

In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction. Here\u2019s a question to test the point. I\u2019ve tried to make it a little tricky, but if you\u2019ve read the discussion above it should be easy.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Something special. Ito, a stockbroker, lives and works in Massachusetts, a state that has modeled its rules of procedure after the Federal Rules. He is served in Massachusetts with the complaint and summons in an action Ervin has brought against him in a Nevada court, seeking recovery for misrepresentation in the sale of stock. Assume that Nevada requires a defendant to challenge jurisdiction through the traditional special appearance. Ito\u2019s attorney files a special appearance in the Nevada court objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. A week later, while the objection is pending, he files a motion to dismiss claiming that the case was not filed within the applicable statute of limitations. The court would\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nconclude that Ito had waived his objection to personal jurisdiction by raising the limitations issue.\n\nAnalysis:\nB is the best answer. By the procedural faux pas of asserting the limitations objection, Ito has waived his objection to personal jurisdiction and the court will proceed to hear the case. It is true that, if Ito\u2019s lawyer had filed the same two objections in a state that uses the Federal Rules approach, his objection to personal jurisdiction would not be waived. But he didn\u2019t. The special appearance approach is more restrictive, and when in Nevada, you have to do as the Nevadans do.\n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nThe natural inclination of the defendant who thinks she\u2019s been sued in the wrong court is to protest. You\u2019d feel the same way. \u2018\u2018Hey, wait! This case doesn\u2019t belong here; throw it out.\u2019\u2019 All court systems provide a procedure for defendants to appear at the outset of the case and object to the court\u2019s exercising jurisdiction over them. The older, common law approach was the \u2018\u2018special appearance.\u2019\u2019 The defendant would \u2018\u2018appear specially\u2019\u2019 for the sole purpose of objecting to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. The court would hear the objection, and dismiss if it agreed that it lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendant. If it disagreed, of course, it would proceed with the case. However, when the defendant made a special appearance, she had to be careful not to raise any issue other than personal jurisdiction. Even before Pennoyer, courts held that a defendant may waive her objection to personal jurisdiction. Many courts held that a defendant who appeared to object to jurisdiction had to confine her appearance to that purpose. If she strayed beyond arguing jurisdiction, she was deemed to be litigating the case on the merits, which implied that she accepted the court\u2019s authority to adjudicate it. For example, if the defendant appeared and objected to personal jurisdiction and also argued that the complaint failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted, she had joined issue on the merits, and that implied submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. She would be deemed, by adding the failure-to-state-a-claim objection (or any objection other than to jurisdiction) to have \u2018\u2018appeared generally,\u2019\u2019 waiving her special appearance and accepting the court\u2019s power to hear the case. Thus, a good many older (and some recent) cases conclude, based on some ill-considered argument by defense counsel, that the defendant had fallen over the line and consented to jurisdiction. See, e.g., Davis v. Eighth Judicial Dist. of Nevada, 629 P.2d 1209 (Nev. 1981) (defendants waived special appearance by opposing plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend complaint). Some states even held that a defendant who failed to specifically designate its appearance as a \u2018\u2018special appearance\u2019\u2019 had forfeited the objection and consented to suit in the state. A hundred years ago, the special appearance was the standard procedure for challenging personal jurisdiction at the outset of a case. However, the federal courts, in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and an increasing number of states, have adopted a more flexible approach. Under the Federal Rules, and in states that have modeled their procedural rules on them, a defendant who objects to personal jurisdiction may raise her objection to jurisdiction before answering the complaint, by moving to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Alternatively, she may raise the objection in her answer to the complaint instead. The Federal Rules approach is more flexible because, when the defendant asserts the objection, she may combine it with other objections or defenses without waiving her objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction. For example, she might move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and also for failure to state a claim. She would not lose her objection to jurisdiction by raising it with the objection that challenges the case on the merits. Similarly, in a jurisdiction that uses this approach, she could answer the complaint, raising all of her defenses on the merits, and include her objection to personal jurisdiction in her answer. Combining the challenge to personal jurisdiction with other defenses would not waive the objection to personal jurisdiction. However, there\u2019s a trap for the unwary under the Federal Rules too. While objections to jurisdiction may be combined with others, they must be raised in the defendant\u2019s first response to the complaint. She may move to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for other reasons. She may answer, raising defenses to the merits of the claim and objecting to personal jurisdiction. But she may not, for example, respond first by moving to dismiss for failure to state a claim, and later answer the complaint, including an objection to personal jurisdiction. By failing to include the jurisdictional objection in her first response to the complaint (here, her motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim), she would waive the objection to jurisdiction. Similarly, if she answers the complaint without including her jurisdictional objection, she waives it as well. (The technicalities of this are explored more fully in Chapter 18 on pre-answer motions.) This rule, that the defendant waives the objection by failing to assert it right away, prevents the defendant from gaming the system. If she could raise the objection to jurisdiction at any time, she might keep the objection in her back pocket, and see how the litigation goes. If her case turns sour on the merits, she might then assert her objection to jurisdiction, in an effort to get the case dismissed after substantial litigation has taken place. The raise-it-or-lose-it rule assures that, if no personal jurisdiction objection is raised at the outset, the court will have authority to hear the case. In many states today, the rules of civil procedure are modeled on the Federal Rules. In these states, the more flexible motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction has replaced the common law special appearance. Students frequently believe that a defendant has a choice to use either procedure within a single state. That isn\u2019t right; a state will either continue to use the common law special appearance approach, or have changed its procedural rules to adopt the Federal Rules approach. If it has adopted the more flexible federal approach, the defendant should raise the objection by moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, or put it in her answer. If the state continues to follow the common law approach, the defendant should\u2014very carefully\u2014enter a special appearance to challenge personal jurisdiction.

The court would\n\nAnswer Candidate:\nhear and decide the jurisdictional objection, since Ito has properly raised the objection by making a special appearance.\n\nAnalysis:\n That is just what Ito did here; he objected to jurisdiction, but then raised a defense on the merits as well. True, he raised the objection to personal jurisdiction first, but under (the assumed) Nevada law any response that appears to litigate the substantive issues in the case waives the special appearance and consents to the jurisdiction of the court. So A isn\u2019t quite right; although Ito properly made a special appearance, his later motion raising the limitations issue waives his objection to jurisdiction. Ito should have waited to make his second motion until the personal jurisdiction issue was resolved. \n\nLabel:\n0", "Introduction:\nRule 12 lays several traps for the unwary defendant.

The Strawbridge rule illustrates one situation in which the statutory grant is narrower than the constitutional authority. Another example is the amount-in-controversy requirement. Article III, \u00a72 contains no monetary restriction on diversity jurisdiction; it broadly authorizes jurisdiction over all cases between citizens of different states. Congress\u2019s grant of diversity jurisdiction to the federal district courts, however, includes an amount-in-controversy requirement, in order to keep small diversity cases out of federal court. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a71332(a) (granting jurisdiction over diversity cases in which \u2018\u2018the amount in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000, exclusive of interest or costs\u2019\u2019). Here\u2019s a mediocre question, included to make a point.\n\nQuestion:\n8. By the numbers.

It simply asks a factual question and gives you four choices, one of them right (D). To answer it, you simply need to remember a fact, not analyze a problem. This is easier, and less imaginative, than questions that require you to apply a concept to a subtle set of facts. Analytical questions call for a higher order of reasoning than this amount-in-controversy hypo. Most professors will test your analytical skills, since they are trying to teach you to think, not memorize. So I think you will find the more analytical examples in this book more representative of law school exams\u2014either multiple-choice or essay exams. Similarly, the multi-state bar exam also focuses on proper application of legal rules to facts, not memorization of black letter law. \n\nLabel:\n1\n\nIntroduction:\nSo you get that elusive first job, start work, and you are asked to sue somebody. (Oh my goodness! What do I actually do?) Well, start by doing what my students always resist doing: look at the rules.

And you will probably start by figuring out what you have to deliver to the defendant and figuring out who should do it.

D is also improper, because it is not the clerk\u2019s job to serve the papers on the defendant.
